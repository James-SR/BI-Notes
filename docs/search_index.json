Other vendors have specfic versions of SQL for instance Oracle is PL/SQL, Microsoft’s implentation is TSQL or Transact SQL. Both SQL Server (on prem) and Azure SQL Databases (cloud) use the same query language, however Azure is a subset of full TSQL since it some commands relate to local files and data functions within .NET that relate only to SQL Server. However, as new features are added to Azure, some new commands are being added to Azure. SQL is a declarative language - you express what it is that you want, the results - rather than specifying the steps taken to acheive that - it is not prodecural like other programming languages, it is set theory based. It is possible to write proceedural elements or steps within TSQL, however if this is ocurring a lot, it is perhaps better done in another language, which may also perform or run better. In databases, we typically talk about entities - one type of thing - which is contained in each table. * Entities are represented as relations (tables) * And entity attributes as domains (columns) Most relationships are normalized, with relationships between primary and foreign keys. This helps to reduce duplication, however there are instances where de-normalised data is desired. Schemas are namespaces for database objects - is shows a logical layout for all or part of a relational database, “As part of a data dictionary, a database schema indicates how the entities that make up the database relate to one another, including tables, views, stored procedures, and more.”(see Lucid Chart on Database Schemas). The process of creating a database schema is called data modelling. When referring to objects in a database, we could use a fully qualified name, such as: [server_name.][database_name.][schema_name.]object_name This is only really relevant for SQL Server, since Azure will only work with one database at a time. Most of the time we typically just use schema_name.object_name The schema name somwtimes be discarded, but it is considered best practice to include this, since there is sometimes some ambiguity about tables e.g. if we have two tables - Product.Order and Customer.Order - which order table is being referred to, that in the customer or product schema? SQL has a number of SQL Statement Types: DML or Data Manipulation Language - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE DDL or Data Definition Language - CREATE, ALTER, DROP DCL or Data Control Language - GRANT, REVOKE, DENY The course focuses on DML which is typically for working with data. SELECT statement has a number of possible sub-components: FROM [table] WHERE [condition for filtering rows] GROUP BY [arranges rows by groups] HAVING [condition for filtering groups] ORDER BY [sorts the output] Whilst a SQL statement can look like English, it doesn’t neccessarily run from top to bottom in terms of the sequence of elements that are run in a query. For instance, the FROM is the first thing that will be run, then the WHERE filter will be run, then we GROUP BY, then SELECT the columns we are interested in and finally ORDER the results. This can be important when running some queries, which will be explored later in the course. When we run a query, it is not an actual table in a database that is return but a set of rows or record set or subset. 1.1.1 Data Types There are a number of different data types in T-SQL as shown below, which are grouped in to a number of different types. (#fig:Data Types)Transact-SQL Data Types This is more relevant when designing a database, however it is useful to know when querying what data type you have in a broad sense - numeric, data, string and so on - as the types will determine what type of combinations can be combined together in expressions e.g. you can concatenate strings or add numbers together, but you can’t concatenate a string and a number together. Sometimes it is neccessary to convert data from one type to another, there are two ways this could happen Implicit conversion - compatible data types are automatically converted Explicit conversion - requires an explicit function e.g. CAST / TRY_CAST, STR, PARSE ? TRY_PARSE, CONVERT / TRY_CONVERT The TRY options will attempt a conversion and if it does not work, a NULL will be returned rather than an error in the non-TRY version. 1.1.2 Working with NULLs There are recognised standards for treating NULL values - ANSI - which says that anythign involving a NULL should return a NULL. There are functions that help us handle NULL values: ISNULL(column/variable, value) - Returns value (which you can specify) if the column or variable is NULL NULLIF(column/variable, value) - Returns NULL if the column or variable is a value - we are almost recoding a non-null to a null COALESCE (column/variable1, column/variable2, …) - Returns the value of the first non-NULL column or variable in the list - for instance if contact details, someone might not have an email, so we might want a telephone number, if they don’t have that, return an address etc NULL is used to indicate an unknown or missing value. NULL is not equivalent to zero or an empty string. ISNULL can be used like an IF function in excel, for instance: SELECT name, ISNULL(TRY_CAST(size AS Integer), 0) AS NumericSize FROM SalesLT.Product; In this instance, if there is a value that will be returned, if not, the NULL value will be returned as a 0. We can also use a CASE statement to return a value whilst integrating NULL in to our query, e.g. SELECT name, CASE size WHEN &#39;S&#39; THEN &#39;SMALL&#39; WHEN &#39;M&#39; THEN &#39;MEDIUM&#39; WHEN &#39;L&#39; THEN &#39;LARGE&#39; WHEN &#39;XL&#39; THEN &#39;EXTRA LARGE&#39; ELSE ISNULL(Size, &#39;N/A&#39;) END AS PRODUCT FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.1: Displaying records 1 - 10 name PRODUCT HL Road Frame - Black, 58 58 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 58 Sport-100 Helmet, Red N/A Sport-100 Helmet, Black N/A Mountain Bike Socks, M MEDIUM Mountain Bike Socks, L LARGE Sport-100 Helmet, Blue N/A AWC Logo Cap N/A Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S SMALL Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M MEDIUM 1.1.3 Lab Exercises AdventureWorks Cycles is a company that sells directly to retailers, who then sell products to consumers. Each retailer that is an AdventureWorks customer has provided a named contact for all communication from AdventureWorks. The sales manager at AdventureWorks has asked you to generate some reports containing details of the company’s customers to support a direct sales campaign. Let’s start with some basic exploration. First we display the sales person, the customer’s title, surname and telephone number SELECT SalesPerson, Title + &#39; &#39; + LastName AS CustomerName, Phone FROM SalesLT.Customer; Table 1.2: Displaying records 1 - 10 SalesPerson CustomerName Phone adventure-works0 Mr. Gee 245-555-0173 adventure-works8 Mr. Harris 170-555-0127 adventure-works0 Ms. Carreras 279-555-0130 adventure-works0 Ms. Gates 710-555-0173 adventure-works0 Mr. Harrington 828-555-0186 adventure-works3 Ms. Carroll 244-555-0112 adventure-works0 Mr. Gash 192-555-0173 adventure-works1 Ms. Garza 150-555-0127 adventure-works1 Ms. Harding 926-555-0159 adventure-works1 Mr. Caprio 112-555-0191 Next we cast the CustomerID column to a VARCHAR and concatenate with the CompanyName column SELECT CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) + &#39;: &#39; + CompanyName AS CustomerCompany FROM SalesLT.Customer; CustomerCompany 1: A Bike Store 2: Progressive Sports 3: Advanced Bike Components 4: Modular Cycle Systems 5: Metropolitan Sports Supply 6: Aerobic Exercise Company 7: Associated Bikes 10: Rural Cycle Emporium 11: Sharp Bikes 12: Bikes and Motorbikes The SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table contains records of sales orders. You have been asked to retrieve data for a report that shows: The sales order number and revision number in the format () (e.g. SO71774 (2)). The order date converted to ANSI standard format yyyy.mm.dd (e.g. 2015.01.31). SELECT SalesOrderNumber + &#39; (&#39; + STR(RevisionNumber, 1) + &#39;)&#39; AS OrderRevision, CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), OrderDate, 102) AS OrderDate FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader; Table 1.3: Displaying records 1 - 10 OrderRevision OrderDate SO71774 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71776 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71780 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71782 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71783 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71784 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71796 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71797 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71815 (2) 2008.06.01 SO71816 (2) 2008.06.01 Next we write a query that returns a list of customer names. We use ISNULL to check for middle names and concatenate with FirstName and LastName. SELECT FirstName + &#39; &#39; + ISNULL(MiddleName + &#39; &#39;, &#39;&#39;) + LastName AS CustomerName FROM SalesLT.Customer; CustomerName Orlando N. Gee Keith Harris Donna F. Carreras Janet M. Gates Lucy Harrington Rosmarie J. Carroll Dominic P. Gash Kathleen M. Garza Katherine Harding Johnny A. Caprio Next, we will imagine that some data has been deleted - customer email addresses - then we try to find contact details in sequence. UPDATE SalesLT.Customer SET EmailAddress = NULL WHERE CustomerID % 7 = 1; Next we write a query that returns a list of customer IDs in one column, and a second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if known, and otherwise the phone number. SELECT CustomerID, COALESCE(EmailAddress, Phone) AS PrimaryContact FROM SalesLT.Customer; Table 1.4: Displaying records 1 - 10 CustomerID PrimaryContact 1 245-555-0173 2 keith0@adventure-works.com 3 donna0@adventure-works.com 4 janet1@adventure-works.com 5 lucy0@adventure-works.com 6 rosmarie0@adventure-works.com 7 dominic0@adventure-works.com 10 kathleen0@adventure-works.com 11 katherine0@adventure-works.com 12 johnny0@adventure-works.com You have been asked to create a query that returns a list of sales order IDs and order dates with a column named ShippingStatus that contains the text “Shipped” for orders with a known ship date, and “Awaiting Shipment” for orders with no ship date. Again, we imagine that some data is missing by deleting some first. UPDATE SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader SET ShipDate = NULL WHERE SalesOrderID &gt; 71899; SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate, CASE WHEN ShipDate IS NULL THEN &#39;Awaiting Shipment&#39; ELSE &#39;Shipped&#39; END AS ShippingStatus FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader; Table 1.5: Displaying records 1 - 10 SalesOrderID OrderDate ShippingStatus 71774 2008-06-01 Shipped 71776 2008-06-01 Shipped 71780 2008-06-01 Shipped 71782 2008-06-01 Shipped 71783 2008-06-01 Shipped 71784 2008-06-01 Shipped 71796 2008-06-01 Shipped 71797 2008-06-01 Shipped 71815 2008-06-01 Shipped 71816 2008-06-01 Shipped 1.2 Querying Tables with SELECT 1.2.1 Removing Duplicates If we wanted to know what colours our products are, we would run something like the following. SELECT Color FROM SalesLT.Product; Color Black Red Red Black White White Blue Multi Multi Multi Here each product has a row and corresponding colour. However, if we just want colour, we are typically interested in removing duplicates to just show what colours we are actually producing. This is achieve using the DISTINCT keyword SELECT DISTINCT Color FROM SalesLT.Product; Color NA Black Blue Grey Multi Red Silver Silver/Black White Yellow These results are DISTINCT at the row level, so if we have two combinitions of columns - say size and colour - then it would be DISTINCT colour and size combinations that appear in the database. SELECT DISTINCT Color, Size FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.6: Displaying records 1 - 10 Color Size NA NA Black NA Black 38 Black 40 Black 42 Black 44 Black 46 Black 48 Black 52 Black 58 Here is just the size - here IS NULL will return a ‘None’ if the Size is missing (NA). SELECT DISTINCT ISNULL(Size, &#39;None&#39;) AS Size FROM SalesLT.Product; Size 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 1.2.2 Sorting Results ORDER By is how we sort the results. Any aliased fields used in the SELECT element are visible by ORDER BY. You can oder the results using columns that are not selected in the SELECT clause. You can also ORDER BY multiple columns, either ascending or descending. We can also just show the top 10 products, e.g. the top 10 most expensive. This is done using the keywork TOP SELECT TOP (10) ProductCategoryID AS Category, Name, ListPrice FROM SalesLT.Product ORDER BY ListPrice DESC, Category; Table 1.7: Displaying records 1 - 10 Category Name ListPrice 6 Road-150 Red, 62 3578.27 6 Road-150 Red, 44 3578.27 6 Road-150 Red, 48 3578.27 6 Road-150 Red, 52 3578.27 6 Road-150 Red, 56 3578.27 5 Mountain-100 Silver, 38 3399.99 5 Mountain-100 Silver, 42 3399.99 5 Mountain-100 Silver, 44 3399.99 5 Mountain-100 Silver, 48 3399.99 5 Mountain-100 Black, 38 3374.99 We can also use TOP (N) Percent or TOP (N) WITH TIES. If we say wanted the bottom 10 items - say those with the lowest price - there is no ‘BOTTOM’ Keyword, instead we would sort our data so that they are now in the the order we want - with those we are interested at the top - the use TOP again. 1.2.3 Paging through results This is achieved through using the OFFSET-FETCH which is an extension of ORDER BY. This might be useful if you have a set of web page results and you want to see certain ones. You first say how many rows you want to skip using e.g. OFFSET 10 ROWS, then use specify how many rows you are interested in retrieving from the database e.g. FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY. 1.2.4 Filtering and Using Predicates We can use the WHERE clause with a number of coniditions or predicates. For instance = (equals) &lt;&gt; (not equals), IN, BETWEEN (is an inclusive statement e.g. BETWEEN 100 AND 200 includes 100 and 200), LIKE, AND, OR and NOT. IN can be more efficient in coding terms when testing multiple attributes, as you just say color IN (red, blue) rather than colour = ‘red’ OR colour = ‘blue’. This becomes more useful when testing multiple conditions e.g. IN (red, blue) AND size = large - this would have more typing with explicit code for each combition. Like mathematics, SQL works on PEMDAS sequencing - parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. Some examples. First look for products that start with an FR: SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ProductNumber LIKE &#39;FR%&#39;; Table 1.8: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name Color Size ProductNumber HL Road Frame - Black, 58 Black 58 FR-R92B-58 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 Red 58 FR-R92R-58 HL Road Frame - Red, 62 Red 62 FR-R92R-62 HL Road Frame - Red, 44 Red 44 FR-R92R-44 HL Road Frame - Red, 48 Red 48 FR-R92R-48 HL Road Frame - Red, 52 Red 52 FR-R92R-52 HL Road Frame - Red, 56 Red 56 FR-R92R-56 LL Road Frame - Black, 58 Black 58 FR-R38B-58 LL Road Frame - Black, 60 Black 60 FR-R38B-60 LL Road Frame - Black, 62 Black 62 FR-R38B-62 Or we can look for products that end in a 58: SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ProductNumber LIKE &#39;%58&#39;; Table 1.9: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name Color Size ProductNumber HL Road Frame - Black, 58 Black 58 FR-R92B-58 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 Red 58 FR-R92R-58 LL Road Frame - Black, 58 Black 58 FR-R38B-58 LL Road Frame - Red, 58 Red 58 FR-R38R-58 ML Road Frame - Red, 58 Red 58 FR-R72R-58 Road-450 Red, 58 Red 58 BK-R68R-58 Road-650 Red, 58 Red 58 BK-R50R-58 Road-650 Black, 58 Black 58 BK-R50B-58 Road-250 Red, 58 Red 58 BK-R89R-58 Road-250 Black, 58 Black 58 BK-R89B-58 Or we can use underscores to specify a number of charecters e.g. one _ is one missing charecter. A wildcard (%) would match any number of chars. The figures in brackets then are like regex, so if we want a numeric value between 0 and 9 we use [0-9]. Equally we could use a similar query to find things like email addresses in a string, or email addresses that end in a .co.uk. SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ProductNumber LIKE &#39;BK-_[0-9][0-9]_-[0-9][0-9]&#39;; Table 1.10: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name Color Size ProductNumber Road-150 Red, 62 Red 62 BK-R93R-62 Road-150 Red, 44 Red 44 BK-R93R-44 Road-150 Red, 48 Red 48 BK-R93R-48 Road-150 Red, 52 Red 52 BK-R93R-52 Road-150 Red, 56 Red 56 BK-R93R-56 Road-450 Red, 58 Red 58 BK-R68R-58 Road-450 Red, 60 Red 60 BK-R68R-60 Road-450 Red, 44 Red 44 BK-R68R-44 Road-450 Red, 48 Red 48 BK-R68R-48 Road-450 Red, 52 Red 52 BK-R68R-52 We can use the BETWEEN clause on things like dates to select all products that were removed from sale in 2016: SELECT Name FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE SellEndDate BETWEEN &#39;2006/1/1&#39; AND &#39;2006/12/31&#39;; Name Mountain Bike Socks, M Mountain Bike Socks, L ML Road Frame - Red, 44 ML Road Frame - Red, 48 ML Road Frame - Red, 52 ML Road Frame - Red, 58 ML Road Frame - Red, 60 HL Mountain Frame - Silver, 44 HL Mountain Frame - Silver, 48 HL Mountain Frame - Black, 44 Note that it is often useful to order results in the order you want, even if it currently appears it the correct order. Sometimes these queries may change as data or the database does, so it is best to be explicit and use an ORDER BY. 1.2.5 Lab Exercises You are being told that transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products. -- select the top 10 percent from the Name column SELECT TOP (10) Percent Name, Weight FROM SalesLT.Product -- order by the weight in descending order ORDER BY Weight DESC; Table 1.11: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name Weight Touring-3000 Blue, 62 13607.70 Touring-3000 Yellow, 62 13607.70 Touring-3000 Blue, 58 13562.34 Touring-3000 Yellow, 58 13512.45 Touring-3000 Blue, 54 13462.55 Touring-3000 Yellow, 54 13344.62 Touring-3000 Yellow, 50 13213.08 Touring-3000 Blue, 50 13213.08 Touring-3000 Blue, 44 13049.78 Touring-3000 Yellow, 44 13049.78 Next, we want to ignore the first 10 records - to page through using offset SELECT Name FROM SalesLT.Product ORDER BY Weight DESC -- offset 10 rows and get the next 100 OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS ONLY; Name Mountain-500 Silver, 52 Mountain-500 Black, 52 Mountain-500 Black, 48 Mountain-500 Silver, 48 Mountain-500 Silver, 44 Mountain-500 Black, 44 Touring-2000 Blue, 60 Mountain-500 Black, 42 Mountain-500 Silver, 42 Touring-2000 Blue, 54 Next we create a query to find the names, colors, and sizes of the products with a product model ID of 1. -- select the Name, Color, and Size columns SELECT Name, Color, Size FROM SalesLT.Product -- check ProductModelID is 1 WHERE ProductModelID = 1; Table 1.12: 3 records Name Color Size Classic Vest, S Blue S Classic Vest, M Blue M Classic Vest, L Blue L Now we would like more information on products of certain colors and sizes. We retrieve the product number and name of the products that have a Color of ‘Black’, ‘Red’, or ‘White’ and a Size of ‘S’ or ‘M’. -- select the ProductNumber and Name columns SELECT ProductNumber, Name FROM SalesLT.Product -- check that Color is one of &#39;Black&#39;, &#39;Red&#39; or &#39;White&#39; -- check that Size is one of &#39;S&#39; or &#39;M&#39; WHERE Color IN (&#39;Black&#39;, &#39;Red&#39;, &#39;White&#39;) AND Size IN (&#39;S&#39;, &#39;M&#39;); Table 1.13: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductNumber Name SO-B909-M Mountain Bike Socks, M SH-M897-S Men’s Sports Shorts, S SH-M897-M Men’s Sports Shorts, M TG-W091-S Women’s Tights, S TG-W091-M Women’s Tights, M GL-H102-S Half-Finger Gloves, S GL-H102-M Half-Finger Gloves, M GL-F110-S Full-Finger Gloves, S GL-F110-M Full-Finger Gloves, M SH-W890-S Women’s Mountain Shorts, S Next you have been asked to retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products that have a product number beginning with ‘BK-’. -- select the ProductNumber, Name, and ListPrice columns SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice FROM SalesLT.Product -- filter for product numbers beginning with BK- using LIKE WHERE ProductNumber LIKE &#39;BK-%&#39;; Table 1.14: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductNumber Name ListPrice BK-R93R-62 Road-150 Red, 62 3578.27 BK-R93R-44 Road-150 Red, 44 3578.27 BK-R93R-48 Road-150 Red, 48 3578.27 BK-R93R-52 Road-150 Red, 52 3578.27 BK-R93R-56 Road-150 Red, 56 3578.27 BK-R68R-58 Road-450 Red, 58 1457.99 BK-R68R-60 Road-450 Red, 60 1457.99 BK-R68R-44 Road-450 Red, 44 1457.99 BK-R68R-48 Road-450 Red, 48 1457.99 BK-R68R-52 Road-450 Red, 52 1457.99 Finally, the product manager is interested in a slight variation of the last request regarding product numbers with a particular prefix. We are interested in products with product number beginning with ‘BK-’ followed by any character other than ‘R’, and ending with a ‘-’ followed by any two numerals. Not an R is [^R]. -- select the ProductNumber, Name, and ListPrice columns SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice FROM SalesLT.Product -- filter for ProductNumbers WHERE ProductNumber LIKE &#39;BK-[^R]%-[0-9][0-9]&#39;; Table 1.15: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductNumber Name ListPrice BK-M82S-38 Mountain-100 Silver, 38 3399.99 BK-M82S-42 Mountain-100 Silver, 42 3399.99 BK-M82S-44 Mountain-100 Silver, 44 3399.99 BK-M82S-48 Mountain-100 Silver, 48 3399.99 BK-M82B-38 Mountain-100 Black, 38 3374.99 BK-M82B-42 Mountain-100 Black, 42 3374.99 BK-M82B-44 Mountain-100 Black, 44 3374.99 BK-M82B-48 Mountain-100 Black, 48 3374.99 BK-M68S-38 Mountain-200 Silver, 38 2319.99 BK-M68S-42 Mountain-200 Silver, 42 2319.99 1.3 Querying Tables with Joins We usually join tables based on primary key - foreign key relationships. We don’t run two queries then join, but match at the time of the query. When we are talking about joins, we typically represent them as Venn diagrams. The convention (ANSI SQL-92) is to specify the JOIN operator in the FROM clause: SELECT … FROM Table1 JOIN Table 2 ON ; There is an older standard (ANSI SQL-89) where the tables are joined using commas in the FROM clause and using a WHERE operator, but this can lead to accidental cartesian (aka cross) products. 1.3.1 INNER Joins INNER Joins are typically the most common join type. It involves a join only where a match is found in both input tables. You can add multiple joins after each other. Some examples - first a basic inner join where the schema, table and column are explicitly stated. SELECT SalesLT.Product.Name AS ProductName, SalesLT.ProductCategory.Name AS Category FROM SalesLT.Product INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory ON SalesLT.Product.ProductCategoryID = SalesLT.ProductCategory.ProductCategoryID; Table 1.16: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductName Category Mountain-100 Silver, 38 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Silver, 42 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Silver, 44 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Silver, 48 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 38 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 42 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 44 Mountain Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 48 Mountain Bikes Mountain-200 Silver, 38 Mountain Bikes Mountain-200 Silver, 42 Mountain Bikes Next, we can do the same query but make this less cumbersome by using table aliases.

If we don’t specify the join type, the assumption is it is a INNER join, as shown below. SELECT oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderNumber, p.Name As ProductName, od.OrderQty, od.UnitPrice, od.LineTotal FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID ORDER BY oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderID, od.SalesOrderDetailID; Table 1.18: Displaying records 1 - 10 OrderDate SalesOrderNumber ProductName OrderQty UnitPrice LineTotal 2008-06-01 SO71774 ML Road Frame-W - Yellow, 48 1 356.898 356.8980 2008-06-01 SO71774 ML Road Frame-W - Yellow, 38 1 356.898 356.8980 2008-06-01 SO71776 Rear Brakes 1 63.900 63.9000 2008-06-01 SO71780 ML Mountain Frame-W - Silver, 42 4 218.454 873.8160 2008-06-01 SO71780 Mountain-400-W Silver, 46 2 461.694 923.3880 2008-06-01 SO71780 Mountain-500 Silver, 52 6 112.998 406.7928 2008-06-01 SO71780 HL Mountain Frame - Silver, 38 2 818.700 1637.4000 2008-06-01 SO71780 Mountain-500 Black, 42 1 323.994 323.9940 2008-06-01 SO71780 LL Mountain Frame - Black, 48 1 149.874 149.8740 2008-06-01 SO71780 HL Mountain Frame - Black, 42 1 809.760 809.7600 It is possible to do joins based on more than one criteria, e.g. we could join based on the productID and where the ListPrice is less than the unitprice i.e. there has been a discount. -- Multiple join predicates SELECT oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderNumber, p.Name As ProductName, od.OrderQty, od.UnitPrice, od.LineTotal FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND od.UnitPrice &lt; p.ListPrice --Note multiple predicates ORDER BY oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderID, od.SalesOrderDetailID; Table 1.19: Displaying records 1 - 10 OrderDate SalesOrderNumber ProductName OrderQty UnitPrice LineTotal 2008-06-01 SO71774 ML Road Frame-W - Yellow, 48 1 356.898 356.8980 2008-06-01 SO71774 ML Road Frame-W - Yellow, 38 1 356.898 356.8980 2008-06-01 SO71776 Rear Brakes 1 63.900 63.9000 2008-06-01 SO71780 ML Mountain Frame-W - Silver, 42 4 218.454 873.8160 2008-06-01 SO71780 Mountain-400-W Silver, 46 2 461.694 923.3880 2008-06-01 SO71780 Mountain-500 Silver, 52 6 112.998 406.7928 2008-06-01 SO71780 HL Mountain Frame - Silver, 38 2 818.700 1637.4000 2008-06-01 SO71780 Mountain-500 Black, 42 1 323.994 323.9940 2008-06-01 SO71780 LL Mountain Frame - Black, 48 1 149.874 149.8740 2008-06-01 SO71780 HL Mountain Frame - Black, 42 1 809.760 809.7600 1.3.2 OUTER Joins In an outer join we return all the rows from one table, and any matching rows from the second table. The records in the ‘outer’ table are preserved, typically we use language such as LEFT, RIGHT and FULL keywords. We are pulling in records from that OUTER table. FULL keeps records from both tables, but are typically not seen in practice. OUTER is OPTIONAL e.g. LEFT JOIN is the same as LEFT OUTER JOIN. Now some examples. First, we bring up a list of customers, with any matching sales records i.e. we have a list of customers who HAVE bought someting and those WHO HAVE NOT. --Get all customers, with sales orders for those who&#39;ve bought anything SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderNumber FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID ORDER BY c.CustomerID; Table 1.20: Displaying records 1 - 10 FirstName LastName SalesOrderNumber Orlando Gee NA Keith Harris NA Donna Carreras NA Janet Gates NA Lucy Harrington NA Rosmarie Carroll NA Dominic Gash NA Kathleen Garza NA Katherine Harding NA Johnny Caprio NA Next we can look just for those customers who have not purchased anything using IS NULL. --Return only customers who haven&#39;t purchased anything SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderNumber FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID WHERE oh.SalesOrderNumber IS NULL ORDER BY c.CustomerID; Table 1.21: Displaying records 1 - 10 FirstName LastName SalesOrderNumber Orlando Gee NA Keith Harris NA Donna Carreras NA Janet Gates NA Lucy Harrington NA Rosmarie Carroll NA Dominic Gash NA Kathleen Garza NA Katherine Harding NA Johnny Caprio NA Next we add records from multiple tables. If we add tables on to the chain of tables, having first decleared a left or right join, you have to keep using LEFT joins. You could use an INNER Join but you would loose some records e.g. if you used an INNER join on the second table below, you would loose those records (products) that had never been sold. Sometimes it is neccessary to go through one table to get to another e.g. to Products -&gt; Orders requires going through order details first. Even if, we are not brining back any tables from the intermediary table. --More than 2 tables SELECT p.Name As ProductName, oh.SalesOrderNumber FROM SalesLT.Product AS p LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh --Additional tables added to the right must also use a left join ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID ORDER BY p.ProductID; Table 1.22: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductName SalesOrderNumber HL Road Frame - Black, 58 NA HL Road Frame - Red, 58 NA Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71782 Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71783 Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71784 Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71797 Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71902 Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71936 Sport-100 Helmet, Red SO71938 Sport-100 Helmet, Black SO71782 Next another example with multiple tables, but this time the order of the tables is different. We SELECT from the product table, then we LEFT Join the Order details so we can identify products that have never sold, then we LEFT JOIN to the order header table so we can get the order number where we use a left outer join as we are left joining those records to our original table. Then we INNER Join product category, because we are joining product category back to the first table - Products. The final table joins back to our original table, before the outer joins. So whether you need to use an OUTER or INNER join depends on where you wish to place the records based on the current list of tables, however you could reorder the tables to do it differently e.g. do the INNER JOIN first, then then LEFT JOINS. SELECT p.Name As ProductName, c.Name AS Category, oh.SalesOrderNumber FROM SalesLT.Product AS p LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c --Added to the left, so can use inner join ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID ORDER BY p.ProductID; Table 1.23: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductName Category SalesOrderNumber HL Road Frame - Black, 58 Road Frames NA HL Road Frame - Red, 58 Road Frames NA Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71782 Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71783 Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71784 Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71797 Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71902 Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71936 Sport-100 Helmet, Red Helmets SO71938 Sport-100 Helmet, Black Helmets SO71782 ** Key Points** Use a Left Outer Join to include all rows from the first table and values from matched rows in the second table. Columns in the second table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs. Use a Right Outer Join to include all rows from the second table and values from matched rows in the first table. Columns in the first table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs. Use a Full Outer Join to include all rows from the first and second tables. Columns in the either table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs. 1.3.3 Cross Joins Cross Joins create caretesian products - they combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table - to give all possible combinations of products. One example of it being used would be if we have a list of staff with their attributes, we might want to compare them to the attributes required for all jobs to see which they match, perhaps as an internal job search. Another example is if we have two list of addresses and we calculate the edit distance between the two addresses from the different sources, to try and match those addresses. We would rank the addresses based on their edit distance, with those scoring highest the closest and most likely to be the same address. It can be used to generate test data also. An example --Call each customer once per product - perhaps not the most realistic example! SELECT p.Name, c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Phone FROM SalesLT.Product as p CROSS JOIN SalesLT.Customer as c; Table 1.24: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name FirstName LastName Phone All-Purpose Bike Stand Orlando Gee 245-555-0173 All-Purpose Bike Stand Keith Harris 170-555-0127 All-Purpose Bike Stand Donna Carreras 279-555-0130 All-Purpose Bike Stand Janet Gates 710-555-0173 All-Purpose Bike Stand Lucy Harrington 828-555-0186 All-Purpose Bike Stand Rosmarie Carroll 244-555-0112 All-Purpose Bike Stand Dominic Gash 192-555-0173 All-Purpose Bike Stand Kathleen Garza 150-555-0127 All-Purpose Bike Stand Katherine Harding 926-555-0159 All-Purpose Bike Stand Johnny Caprio 112-555-0191 1.3.4 Self Joins You might want to join data on to itself but in a different sequence. For instance, we might want to join a person’s manager on to their employee(s), but managers are also employees, so this would be a self join. We would use aliases for the table names as we have the same table twice. So when defining a self-join, you must specify an alias for at least one instance of the table being joined. So our original table looks like this: SELECT * FROM SalesLT.Employee; Table 1.25: 9 records EmployeeID EmployeeName ManagerID 1 adventure-works8 8 2 adventure-works1 1 3 adventure-works0 NA 4 adventure-works0 3 5 adventure-works1 1 6 adventure-works3 3 7 adventure-works9 9 8 adventure-works0 3 9 adventure-works0 3 Then the actual self join query - we use a left join as some people i.e. the CEO, will not have a manager. SELECT e.EmployeeName, m.EmployeeName AS ManagerName FROM SalesLT.Employee AS e LEFT JOIN SalesLT.Employee AS m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID ORDER BY e.ManagerID; Table 1.26: 9 records EmployeeName ManagerName adventure-works0 NA adventure-works1 adventure-works8 adventure-works1 adventure-works8 adventure-works3 adventure-works0 adventure-works0 adventure-works0 adventure-works0 adventure-works0 adventure-works0 adventure-works0 adventure-works8 adventure-works0 adventure-works9 adventure-works0 1.3.5 Lab Exercises Write a query that returns the company name from the Sale.Customer table, the sales order ID and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table. -- select the CompanyName, SalesOrderId, and TotalDue columns from the appropriate tables SELECT c.CompanyName, oh.SalesOrderId, oh.TotalDue FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh -- join tables based on CustomerID ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID; Table 1.27: Displaying records 1 - 10 CompanyName SalesOrderId TotalDue Professional Sales and Service 71782 43962.7901 Remarkable Bike Store 71935 7330.8972 Bulk Discount Store 71938 98138.2131 Coalition Bike Company 71899 2669.3183 Futuristic Bikes 71895 272.6468 Channel Outlet 71885 608.1766 Aerobic Exercise Company 71915 2361.6403 Vigorous Sports Store 71867 1170.5376 Thrilling Bike Tours 71858 15275.1977 Extreme Riding Supplies 71796 63686.2708 In order to send out invoices to the customers, we need their addresses.

Write a query that returns a column of customer IDs for customers who have never placed an order, and a column of product IDs for products that have never been ordered. Each row with a customer ID should have a NULL product ID (because the customer has never ordered a product) and each row with a product ID should have a NULL customer ID (because the product has never been ordered by a customer). SELECT c.CustomerID, p.ProductID FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c FULL JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID FULL JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od -- join based on the SalesOrderID ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID FULL JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p -- join based on the ProductID ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID -- filter for nonexistent SalesOrderIDs WHERE oh.SalesOrderID IS NULL ORDER BY ProductID, CustomerID; Table 1.31: Displaying records 1 - 10 CustomerID ProductID 1 NA 2 NA 3 NA 4 NA 5 NA 6 NA 7 NA 10 NA 11 NA 12 NA 1.4 Using Set Operators A union query is unlike a join, where as a join adds more columns, a union typically adds more rows. You put all records from one query on to the records at the end of another query. NOTE that it is a list of distinct (non duplicate) records - this will be checked every single row in one table and then checks if that record exists across every single row in the other table. Obviously as more tables are added, checking this can become more time consuming and affects performance. UNION ALL will not undertake this checking, leading to more performance, but some duplicates. John Smith may appear in the employees table but he may also appear in the customers table. Sometimes this is the desired result. In such an instance it makes sense to add a new field using an alias at the time of ther query, such as record type, so we know where this record occurs. When using Union: It is a good idea to use column aliases, so we know which table the column occurs in. However, only aliases in the first query are recognised, so any aliases should be set against the first table The number of columns must be the same across tables, you can add an additional column but this must be given a specific value or a NULL The data types must be approximatley similar i.e. we can do an implicit or explict conversion so they match. The following example joins the Employees to the customer using Union i.e. removing duplicates. NOTE: In the following example, views were created (using code provided in the course), before running the queries on the database. Therefore to reproduce these results, it is neccessary to run that same code (Module 4, Union sql file, in the CourseFiles zip) before the following queries will run on the AdventureWorksLT db. SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Employees UNION SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Customers ORDER BY LastName; Table 1.32: Displaying records 1 - 10 FirstName LastName Catherine Abel Kim Abercrombie Frances Adams Jay Adams Samuel Agcaoili Robert Ahlering Stanley Alan Amy Alberts Paul Alcorn Gregory Alderson This gives 440 rows, if however we use UNION ALL SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Employees UNION ALL SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Customers ORDER BY LastName; Table 1.33: Displaying records 1 - 10 FirstName LastName Catherine Abel Kim Abercrombie Frances Adams Jay Adams Samuel Agcaoili Robert Ahlering Stanley Alan Amy Alberts Paul Alcorn Gregory Alderson This results in 441 rows, so there is 1 row which occurs in both - a Donna Carreras appears both in the customer and emplyee table. This could be the same person or indeed just someone with the same name. It might be useful to know which table the record occurs in, which is where we can introduce a Type column. Not that after the first alias AS Type, subsequent fields e.g. ‘Customer’ as shown below do not need to be explicitly aliased, however it can make it easier to understand if we do include the AS Type. SELECT FirstName, LastName, &#39;Employee&#39; AS Type FROM SalesLT.Employees UNION SELECT FirstName, LastName, &#39;Customer&#39; AS Type FROM SalesLT.Customers ORDER BY LastName OFFSET 100 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY; Table 1.34: 5 records FirstName LastName Type Andy Carothers Employee Donna Carreras Customer Donna Carreras Employee Rosmarie Carroll Employee Joseph Castellucio Employee Note that even though we have used UNION rather than UNION ALL, this would result in the same number of rows as UNION ALL (441), because the presence of the type column means this is no longer the same person - it is not a duplicate record but a unique one. However, it is worth using UNION ALL to limit the number of records that have to be checked for duplicates, so improving peformance. By default, UNION eliminates duplicate rows. Specify the ALL option to include duplicates (or to avoid the overhead of checking for duplicates when you know in advance that there are none). 1.4.1 INTERSECT and EXCEPT Queries In INTERSECT we look at only rows that appear in each set - we are looking for the duplicates. Whereas using a JOIN would append columns to the source table, in set theory, we are looking for rows, so in an INTERSECT we are looking for those rows that appear in both datasets. IN EXCEPT we are looking for records that appear in one source but not the other. In such a scenario, the order of the tables matters. If we now try and identify the person who appears in both our datasets, we can identify the person directly. SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Customers INTERSECT SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Employees; Table 1.35: 1 records FirstName LastName Donna Carreras Next we want to find the EXCEPT - so let’s find customers who are not employees, so we don’t try and sel products to employees. There are 104 customers, so we should get 103 rows, as we remove Donna Carreras.

The functions we will look at are shown below. Figure 1.1: Transact-SQL Functions 1.5.1 Scalar Functions A scalar function returns a single value, not a row or column or table. In database design things can be deterministic or non-deterministic Deterministic - we know what the result will be, assuming the data hasn’t changed. The data going in and coming out will be the same Non-deterministic - we cannot gaurantee what the result will be. For instance if we tested if todays date was less than a value in a table, it would depend on the time and day that the query was run. We can’t say what the result will be, based on the data going in/from the db. A scalar function can be either deterministic or non-deterministic. Scalar is a set of functions, and can do multiple things - date and times, text and image, mathematical, system and system statistical, metadata and so on. We might want to extract the year from a date, for instance to determine when a product was first sold. SELECT YEAR(SellStartDate) SellStartYear, ProductID, Name FROM SalesLT.Product ORDER BY SellStartYear; Table 1.40: Displaying records 1 - 10 SellStartYear ProductID Name 2002 680 HL Road Frame - Black, 58 2002 706 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 2005 707 Sport-100 Helmet, Red 2005 708 Sport-100 Helmet, Black 2005 709 Mountain Bike Socks, M 2005 710 Mountain Bike Socks, L 2005 711 Sport-100 Helmet, Blue 2005 712 AWC Logo Cap 2005 713 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S 2005 714 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M Other examples might include being able to extract certain parts of the date, like the month or day of the week, this can be achived with the DATENAME function SELECT YEAR(SellStartDate) SellStartYear, DATENAME(mm,SellStartDate) SellStartMonth, DAY(SellStartDate) SellStartDay, DATENAME(dw, SellStartDate) SellStartWeekday, ProductID, Name FROM SalesLT.Product ORDER BY SellStartYear; Table 1.41: Displaying records 1 - 10 SellStartYear SellStartMonth SellStartDay SellStartWeekday ProductID Name 2002 June 1 Saturday 680 HL Road Frame - Black, 58 2002 June 1 Saturday 706 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 2005 July 1 Friday 707 Sport-100 Helmet, Red 2005 July 1 Friday 708 Sport-100 Helmet, Black 2005 July 1 Friday 709 Mountain Bike Socks, M 2005 July 1 Friday 710 Mountain Bike Socks, L 2005 July 1 Friday 711 Sport-100 Helmet, Blue 2005 July 1 Friday 712 AWC Logo Cap 2005 July 1 Friday 713 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S 2005 July 1 Friday 714 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M Or we might want to calculate how long a product has been sold, we can use the DATEDIFF function to work this out. SELECT DATEDIFF(yy,SellStartDate, GETDATE()) YearsSold, DATEDIFF(mm,SellStartDate, GETDATE()) MonthsSold, ProductID, Name FROM SalesLT.Product ORDER BY ProductID; Table 1.42: Displaying records 1 - 10 YearsSold MonthsSold ProductID Name 16 189 680 HL Road Frame - Black, 58 16 189 706 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 13 152 707 Sport-100 Helmet, Red 13 152 708 Sport-100 Helmet, Black 13 152 709 Mountain Bike Socks, M 13 152 710 Mountain Bike Socks, L 13 152 711 Sport-100 Helmet, Blue 13 152 712 AWC Logo Cap 13 152 713 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S 13 152 714 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M Another common example might be to convert text to upper case. SELECT UPPER(Name) AS ProductName FROM SalesLT.Product; ProductName ALL-PURPOSE BIKE STAND AWC LOGO CAP BIKE WASH - DISSOLVER CABLE LOCK CHAIN CLASSIC VEST, L CLASSIC VEST, M CLASSIC VEST, S FENDER SET - MOUNTAIN FRONT BRAKES We might want to add two strings together but with a space or other text, so we could use the CONCAT function to achieve this. SELECT CONCAT(FirstName + &#39; &#39;, LastName) AS FullName, FirstName, LastName FROM SalesLT.Customer; Table 1.43: Displaying records 1 - 10 FullName FirstName LastName Orlando Gee Orlando Gee Keith Harris Keith Harris Donna Carreras Donna Carreras Janet Gates Janet Gates Lucy Harrington Lucy Harrington Rosmarie Carroll Rosmarie Carroll Dominic Gash Dominic Gash Kathleen Garza Kathleen Garza Katherine Harding Katherine Harding Johnny Caprio Johnny Caprio Or we might want to return just a specific number of charecters from a string, perhaps there is a structure in the sequence - like the first two chars relate to a product type - so we want to just extract these first two. SELECT Name, ProductNumber, LEFT(ProductNumber, 2) AS ProductType FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.44: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name ProductNumber ProductType HL Road Frame - Black, 58 FR-R92B-58 FR HL Road Frame - Red, 58 FR-R92R-58 FR Sport-100 Helmet, Red HL-U509-R HL Sport-100 Helmet, Black HL-U509 HL Mountain Bike Socks, M SO-B909-M SO Mountain Bike Socks, L SO-B909-L SO Sport-100 Helmet, Blue HL-U509-B HL AWC Logo Cap CA-1098 CA Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S LJ-0192-S LJ Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M LJ-0192-M LJ Or we might have something more complex, where we want to find certain elements of text, we can use CHARINDEX to identify where a char occurs, then combine it with SUBSTRING to extract just a portion of the full string which is n chars before or after a particular charecter. SELECT Name, ProductNumber, LEFT(ProductNumber, 2) AS ProductType, SUBSTRING(ProductNumber,CHARINDEX(&#39;-&#39;, ProductNumber) + 1, 4) AS ModelCode, SUBSTRING(ProductNumber, LEN(ProductNumber) - CHARINDEX(&#39;-&#39;, REVERSE(RIGHT(ProductNumber, 3))) + 2, 2) AS SizeCode FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.45: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name ProductNumber ProductType ModelCode SizeCode HL Road Frame - Black, 58 FR-R92B-58 FR R92B 58 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 FR-R92R-58 FR R92R 58 Sport-100 Helmet, Red HL-U509-R HL U509 R Sport-100 Helmet, Black HL-U509 HL U509 Mountain Bike Socks, M SO-B909-M SO B909 M Mountain Bike Socks, L SO-B909-L SO B909 L Sport-100 Helmet, Blue HL-U509-B HL U509 B AWC Logo Cap CA-1098 CA 1098 Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S LJ-0192-S LJ 0192 S Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M LJ-0192-M LJ 0192 M 1.5.2 Logical Functions Logical functions test if someting is true or not i.e. traditional boolean. But we can use logical functions as filters by using CHOOSE for example, you could use IIF which is also a logical, or we could use CASE to achieve the same result. An exmaple might be if we want to return some numeric sizes, for instance if we have a table of data with different size formats: SELECT Name, Size FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.46: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name Size HL Road Frame - Black, 58 58 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 58 Sport-100 Helmet, Red NA Sport-100 Helmet, Black NA Mountain Bike Socks, M M Mountain Bike Socks, L L Sport-100 Helmet, Blue NA AWC Logo Cap NA Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S S Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M M We might only be interested in those that have a numeric type, even though the data is in a char data string, 1 in this instance means true: SELECT Name, Size AS NumericSize FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ISNUMERIC(Size) = 1; Table 1.47: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name NumericSize HL Road Frame - Black, 58 58 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 58 HL Road Frame - Red, 62 62 HL Road Frame - Red, 44 44 HL Road Frame - Red, 48 48 HL Road Frame - Red, 52 52 HL Road Frame - Red, 56 56 LL Road Frame - Black, 58 58 LL Road Frame - Black, 60 60 LL Road Frame - Black, 62 62 Or we might want to assign a value to something, like a product type of bike to certain values and other to everything else. SELECT Name, IIF(ProductCategoryID IN (5,6,7), &#39;Bike&#39;, &#39;Other&#39;) ProductType FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.48: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name ProductType HL Road Frame - Black, 58 Other HL Road Frame - Red, 58 Other Sport-100 Helmet, Red Other Sport-100 Helmet, Black Other Mountain Bike Socks, M Other Mountain Bike Socks, L Other Sport-100 Helmet, Blue Other AWC Logo Cap Other Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, S Other Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey, M Other Or a more complicated query where we assign mutiple product types. SELECT prd.Name AS ProductName, cat.Name AS Category, CHOOSE (cat.ParentProductCategoryID, &#39;Bikes&#39;,&#39;Components&#39;,&#39;Clothing&#39;,&#39;Accessories&#39;) AS ProductType FROM SalesLT.Product AS prd JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS cat ON prd.ProductCategoryID = cat.ProductCategoryID; Table 1.49: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductName Category ProductType Mountain-100 Silver, 38 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Silver, 42 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Silver, 44 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Silver, 48 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 38 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 42 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 44 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-100 Black, 48 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-200 Silver, 38 Mountain Bikes Bikes Mountain-200 Silver, 42 Mountain Bikes Bikes 1.5.3 Window Functions A window in this context is a set of rows - a window in to the database or table. For instance, we might want to RANK a set (or window) of data. The query below will pull out the top 100 more expensive products (ordered by list price) then creates a ranking based on this list price, then orders the results by this ranking. SELECT TOP(100) ProductID, Name, ListPrice, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ListPrice DESC) AS RankByPrice FROM SalesLT.Product AS p ORDER BY RankByPrice; Table 1.50: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductID Name ListPrice RankByPrice 749 Road-150 Red, 62 3578.27 1 750 Road-150 Red, 44 3578.27 1 751 Road-150 Red, 48 3578.27 1 752 Road-150 Red, 52 3578.27 1 753 Road-150 Red, 56 3578.27 1 771 Mountain-100 Silver, 38 3399.99 6 772 Mountain-100 Silver, 42 3399.99 6 773 Mountain-100 Silver, 44 3399.99 6 774 Mountain-100 Silver, 48 3399.99 6 775 Mountain-100 Black, 38 3374.99 10 Or we might want to partition the results by product category, similar to grouping by product category. This will result in a ranking for each product category. The results might look a little odd at first glance. SELECT c.Name AS Category, p.Name AS Product, ListPrice, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY c.Name ORDER BY ListPrice DESC) AS RankByPrice FROM SalesLT.Product AS p JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductcategoryID ORDER BY Category, RankByPrice; Table 1.51: Displaying records 1 - 10 Category Product ListPrice RankByPrice Bib-Shorts Men’s Bib-Shorts, S 89.99 1 Bib-Shorts Men’s Bib-Shorts, M 89.99 1 Bib-Shorts Men’s Bib-Shorts, L 89.99 1 Bike Racks Hitch Rack - 4-Bike 120.00 1 Bike Stands All-Purpose Bike Stand 159.00 1 Bottles and Cages Mountain Bottle Cage 9.99 1 Bottles and Cages Road Bottle Cage 8.99 2 Bottles and Cages Water Bottle - 30 oz. 4.99 3 Bottom Brackets HL Bottom Bracket 121.49 1 Bottom Brackets ML Bottom Bracket 101.24 2 1.5.4 Aggregate Functions There are a lot of aggregate functions including some statistical functions like s.d. as well as some more standard things like MIN, MAX, SUM etc over a set of data. We can use GROUP BY. First we can get some headline stats of what is in the table. SELECT COUNT(*) AS Products, COUNT(DISTINCT ProductCategoryID) AS Categories, AVG(ListPrice) AS AveragePrice FROM SalesLT.Product; Table 1.52: 1 records Products Categories AveragePrice 295 37 744.5952 Or we might be interested in summary figures for just one product type, like bikes. Note that we use COUNT then the specific item, since using COUNT(*) would return the number of rows, which may include duplicates. SELECT COUNT(p.ProductID) BikeModels, AVG(p.ListPrice) AveragePrice FROM SalesLT.Product AS p JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID WHERE c.Name LIKE &#39;%Bikes&#39;; Table 1.53: 1 records BikeModels AveragePrice 97 1586.737 However, our aggregate functions are currently returnign totals. In practice, we may want to return figures by groups, so we need to use GROUP BY in our queries. When we use a GROUP BY which groups up the results, we have to group up everything in the select row that isn’t being aggregated. You can’t have something in the SELECT which is neither being aggregated nor being grouped. As we are grouping the results, we don’t see individual rows of data anymore. The following example calulates the sales revenue for each sales person. SELECT c.Salesperson, SUM(oh.SubTotal) SalesRevenue FROM SalesLT.Customer c JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader oh ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID GROUP BY c.Salesperson ORDER BY SalesRevenue DESC; Table 1.54: 3 records Salesperson SalesRevenue adventure-works0 518096.4 adventure-works3 209219.8 adventure-works0 138116.9 Could it be that some sales people have no sales? If so, we need to return values where the total is NULL, by assigning NULL a value of zero. WE also use the LEFT JOIN rather than the INNER JOIN previously, we get sales people included who haven’t sold anything. SELECT c.Salesperson, ISNULL(SUM(oh.SubTotal), 0.00) SalesRevenue FROM SalesLT.Customer c LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader oh ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID GROUP BY c.Salesperson ORDER BY SalesRevenue DESC; Table 1.55: 9 records Salesperson SalesRevenue adventure-works0 518096.4 adventure-works3 209219.8 adventure-works0 138116.9 adventure-works9 0.0 adventure-works0 0.0 adventure-works0 0.0 adventure-works1 0.0 adventure-works8 0.0 adventure-works1 0.0 Or we might want to know the number of customers each sales person has. SELECT Salesperson, COUNT(CustomerID) Customers FROM SalesLT.Customer GROUP BY Salesperson ORDER BY Salesperson; Table 1.56: 9 records Salesperson Customers adventure-works8 73 adventure-works1 78 adventure-works0 78 adventure-works0 148 adventure-works1 142 adventure-works3 71 adventure-works9 32 adventure-works0 74 adventure-works0 151 We might also want to know the sales Revenue by sales person and customer. Note that we now includer the customer details, we cannot use the CUSTOMER alias from the SELECT query in the GROUP BY, as the SELECT query is run after the GROUP BY. SELECT c.Salesperson, CONCAT(c.FirstName +&#39; &#39;, c.LastName) AS Customer, ISNULL(SUM(oh.SubTotal), 0.00) SalesRevenue FROM SalesLT.Customer c LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader oh ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID GROUP BY c.Salesperson, CONCAT(c.FirstName +&#39; &#39;, c.LastName) ORDER BY SalesRevenue DESC, Customer; Table 1.57: Displaying records 1 - 10 Salesperson Customer SalesRevenue adventure-works0 Terry Eminhizer 108561.83 adventure-works0 Krishna Sunkammurali 98278.69 adventure-works0 Christopher Beck 88812.86 adventure-works3 Kevin Liu 83858.43 adventure-works0 Jon Grande 78029.69 adventure-works0 Jeffrey Kurtz 74058.81 adventure-works0 Rebecca Laszlo 63980.99 adventure-works3 Anthony Chor 57634.63 adventure-works0 Frank Campbell 41622.05 adventure-works3 Catherine Abel 39785.33 Or the number of products in each category. SELECT c.Name AS Category, COUNT(p.ProductID) AS Products FROM SalesLT.Product AS p JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID GROUP BY c.Name ORDER BY Category; Table 1.58: Displaying records 1 - 10 Category Products Bib-Shorts 3 Bike Racks 1 Bike Stands 1 Bottles and Cages 3 Bottom Brackets 3 Brakes 2 Caps 1 Chains 1 Cleaners 1 Cranksets 3 1.5.5 Filtering Groups If we want to filter, we can use the WHERE clause as we have seen in some previous examples. However, most of the time we filter with the HAVING caluse. HAVING will filter the resutls RATHER than the input. Having clause provides a search condition that each group must satisfy, for instance where the number of orders by a customer is greater than 10. In the example below, we are interested in finding out which sales people have more than 100 customers. SELECT Salesperson, COUNT(CustomerID) Customers FROM SalesLT.Customer GROUP BY Salesperson HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) &gt; 100 ORDER BY Salesperson; Table 1.59: 3 records Salesperson Customers adventure-works0 148 adventure-works1 142 adventure-works0 151 Key Points: You can use GROUP BY with aggregate functions to return aggregations grouped by one or more columns or expressions. All columns in the SELECT clause that are not aggregate function expressions must be included in a GROUP BY clause. The order in which columns or expressions are listed in the GROUP BY clause determines the grouping hierarchy. You can filter the groups that are included in the query results by specifying a HAVING clause. 1.5.6 Lab Exercises Write a query to return the product ID of each product, together with the product name formatted as upper case and a column named ApproxWeight with the weight of each product rounded to the nearest whole unit.

The results of the inner or nested query are pasted to the outer query and behave much like an expression. Our subquery might be scalr, for instance we might have a single value which is passed to the outer query. So we might be interested in the last order (the maxium id) and the details from that order, where the information is held in two different tables. SELECT salesorderid, productid, unitprice, orderqty From SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail WHERE salesorderid = (SELECT MAX(salesorderid) AS lastorder FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader); Table 1.68: 1 records salesorderid productid unitprice orderqty 71946 916 31.584 1 The subquery is in brackets, and the system will treat whatever is in brackets as an individual unit. In a multi-valued query, mutiple values are returned but as a single column set to the outer query. So we might be interested in every customer in Mexico. One will get returned from the subquery is a one dimensional array - a vector. 1.6.1 Self Contained or Correlated Query Queries we have looked at so far are self contained queries. The sub-query parts works, then it supplies its value to the outer query. Correlated sub-queries refer to elements of tables used in the outer query. Because the sub-query is searching for values in the outer query, this can be resource intensive. We might, for instance, make a reference to an employee number in the subquery, but that number is dependent on the result of the outer query, so the subqueriy works with the outer query. As with sub-queries generally, it is best to build the query up iteratively, so you can a) check the query is working and b) check your final sub-query results with those of the individual components to make sure it is doing what it should be. However, this is more difficult when using a correlated query, since there is a dependency. So our goal is for each customer list all sales on the last day that they made a sale. So first, lets get a list of customers with their orders and dates. SELECT CustomerID, SalesOrderID, OrderDate FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SO1 ORDER BY CustomerID,OrderDate Table 1.69: Displaying records 1 - 10 CustomerID SalesOrderID OrderDate 29485 71782 2008-06-01 29531 71935 2008-06-01 29546 71938 2008-06-01 29568 71899 2008-06-01 29584 71895 2008-06-01 29612 71885 2008-06-01 29638 71915 2008-06-01 29644 71867 2008-06-01 29653 71858 2008-06-01 29660 71796 2008-06-01 Then let’s say we want just the latest (max) order date in the db, for each customer ID we have, so we have their individual last order details. SELECT CustomerID, SalesOrderID, OrderDate FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SO1 WHERE orderdate = (SELECT MAX(orderdate) FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SO2 WHERE SO2.CustomerID = SO1.CustomerID) ORDER BY CustomerID; Table 1.70: Displaying records 1 - 10 CustomerID SalesOrderID OrderDate 29485 71782 2008-06-01 29531 71935 2008-06-01 29546 71938 2008-06-01 29568 71899 2008-06-01 29584 71895 2008-06-01 29612 71885 2008-06-01 29638 71915 2008-06-01 29644 71867 2008-06-01 29653 71858 2008-06-01 29660 71796 2008-06-01 1.6.2 The Apply Operator Using an apply operator and a table function can achieve something similar to a correlated query, but in less complicated code. A CROSS APPLY applies the right table expression to each row in the left table, a bit like the correlated sub-query, with CROSS APPLY being similar to a CROSS JOIN. Similarily OUTER APPLY adds rows for those with NULL in columns for the right table, similar to LEFT OUTER JOIN. In these instances, the right table is the table returned by the APPLY function. The first thing we need to do is to create a function. Notice we are passing the function the SalesOrderID, and the most expensive item in the order gets passed back. -- Setup CREATE FUNCTION SalesLT.udfMaxUnitPrice (@SalesOrderID int) RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN SELECT SalesOrderID,Max(UnitPrice) as MaxUnitPrice FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail WHERE SalesOrderID=@SalesOrderID GROUP BY SalesOrderID; To see what code created a function, to help understand what it does at a later time or if created by someone else, we can use the sp_helptext command. sp_helptext &#39;saleslt.udfmaxunitprice&#39; Text – Setup CREATE FUNCTION SalesLT.udfMaxUnitPrice ((???) int) RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN SELECT SalesOrderID,Max(UnitPrice) as MaxUnitPrice FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail WHERE SalesOrderID=@SalesOrderID GROUP BY SalesOrderID; | Then we can use that query to get the results. Note this could have been achieved with a correlated sub-query, but this is perahps a little easier to interpret. SELECT SOH.SalesOrderID, MUP.MaxUnitPrice FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS SOH CROSS APPLY SalesLT.udfMaxUnitPrice(SOH.SalesOrderID) AS MUP ORDER BY SOH.SalesOrderID; Table 1.71: Displaying records 1 - 10 SalesOrderID MaxUnitPrice 71774 356.898 71774 356.898 71776 63.900 71780 1391.994 71780 1391.994 71780 1391.994 71780 1391.994 71780 1391.994 71780 1391.994 71780 1391.994 Key Points: The APPLY operator enables you to execute a table-valued function for each row in a rowset returned by a SELECT statement. Conceptually, this approach is similar to a correlated subquery. CROSS APPLY returns matching rows, similar to an inner join. OUTER APPLY returns all rows in the original SELECT query results with NULL values for rows where no match was found. 1.6.3 Lab Exercises AdventureWorks products each have a standard cost that indicates the cost of manufacturing the product, and a list price that indicates the recommended selling price for the product. This data is stored in the SalesLT.Product table. Whenever a product is ordered, the actual unit price at which it was sold is also recorded in the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table. Use subqueries to compare the cost and list prices for each product with the unit prices charged in each sale. SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ListPrice &gt; (SELECT AVG(UnitPRice) FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail) ORDER BY ProductID; Table 1.72: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductID Name ListPrice 680 HL Road Frame - Black, 58 1431.50 706 HL Road Frame - Red, 58 1431.50 717 HL Road Frame - Red, 62 1431.50 718 HL Road Frame - Red, 44 1431.50 719 HL Road Frame - Red, 48 1431.50 720 HL Road Frame - Red, 52 1431.50 721 HL Road Frame - Red, 56 1431.50 731 ML Road Frame - Red, 44 594.83 732 ML Road Frame - Red, 48 594.83 733 ML Road Frame - Red, 52 594.83 AdventureWorks is interested in finding out which products are being sold at a loss.

Rather than repeatadly joining and selected fields from two tables, we can create a view that contains the join syntax then just select the view. This view can be used and queried as if it were a table. The data is still in the underlying tables, but it is a view or presentation on top of the tables. It’s like a named query, which can make this simpler, plus we can add data at the view level, so they can view rights for the view table, but not the underlying data. Note that whilst you are able to use insert to add new rows, you can only do this to one of the underlying tables. First we create a view -- Create a view CREATE VIEW SalesLT.vCustomerAddress AS SELECT C.CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, AddressLine1, City, StateProvince FROM SalesLT.Customer C JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress CA ON C.CustomerID=CA.CustomerID JOIN SalesLT.Address A ON CA.AddressID=A.AddressID Then we can query the view. SELECT CustomerID, City FROM SalesLT.vCustomerAddress Table 1.78: Displaying records 1 - 10 CustomerID City 29698 Burnaby 29997 Seattle 29854 Joliet 30027 Oxnard 30023 Peoria 29637 Irving 29545 Bothell 29890 Port Orchard 29772 Austin 29883 Denver And we can join data to that view. SELECT c.StateProvince, c.City, ISNULL(SUM(s.TotalDue), 0.00) AS Revenue FROM SalesLT.vCustomerAddress AS c LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS s ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID GROUP BY c.StateProvince, c.City ORDER BY c.StateProvince, Revenue DESC; Table 1.79: Displaying records 1 - 10 StateProvince City Revenue Alberta Calgary 0 Alberta Edmonton 0 Arizona Chandler 0 Arizona Gilbert 0 Arizona Mesa 0 Arizona Phoenix 0 Arizona Scottsdale 0 Arizona Surprise 0 Arizona Tucson 0 British Columbia Vancouver 0 1.7.2 Using Temporary Tables and Table Variables Views are persistent database objects, however we might want a temporary table. We prefix the object with a # symbol and they are created in a seperate temporary database called tempdb, rather than the db you are working in. Typically using a single # will mean the table exists for the current user session. If you wanted it to persistent over multiple sessions, use the ## prefix. An alternative approach is to use table variables, which were introduced to cause performance problems if used again, as the table has to be re-created each user session, which can become a problem if there are many tables. If we want to use one we prefix it with an @ sign to signify it is a variable e.g. (???) table so we define the variable as a table. This is connected to the batch rather than the session, so as long as we are in the block of code. It only works well on small databases or queries. They are for temporary situations or a temporary holding space. In the next block of code we show how we create a temporary table then update and query it. CREATE TABLE #Colors (Color varchar(15)); INSERT INTO #Colors SELECT DISTINCT Color FROM SalesLT.Product; SELECT * FROM #Colors; A table variable is similar, with some syntax differences, but this works on the code set (batch of commans ran at the same time) rather than being for the entire session. DECLARE @Colors AS TABLE (Color varchar(15)); INSERT INTO @Colors SELECT DISTINCT Color FROM SalesLT.Product; SELECT * FROM @Colors; Key Points Temporary tables are prefixed with a # symbol (You can also create global temporary tables that can be accessed by other processes by prefixing the name with ##) Local temporary tables are automatically deleted when the session in which they were created ends. Global temporary tables are deleted when the last user sessions referencing them is closed. Table variables are prefixed with a @ symbol. Table variables are scoped to the batch in which they are created. 1.7.3 Table Value Functions (TVF) This is a specific type of function which returns a table. It is a permanently define database object. Unlike views, we can pass values in to a TVF. So first we create a TVF. CREATE FUNCTION SalesLT.udfCustomersByCity (@City AS VARCHAR(20)) RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN (SELECT C.CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, AddressLine1, City, StateProvince FROM SalesLT.Customer C JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress CA ON C.CustomerID=CA.CustomerID JOIN SalesLT.Address A ON CA.AddressID=A.AddressID WHERE City=@City); Then we can call the TVF passing a parameter - in this instance we prvoide a city name of Bellevue - which will then return the results of the SELECT statement which is a list of customers in that city. SELECT * FROM SalesLT.udfCustomersByCity(&#39;Bellevue&#39;) Table 1.80: 2 records CustomerID FirstName LastName AddressLine1 City StateProvince 29559 Robert Bernacchi 2681 Eagle Peak Bellevue Washington 29559 Robert Bernacchi 25915 140th Ave Ne Bellevue Washington 1.7.4 Derived Tables These are derived tables that return a multi column table. They are a virtual table to simplify a query. The table only exists within that SELECT query. It is a programming construct within a SELECT statement, it is used for programming purposes. They can use internal (aka inline) within the derived table element, or external aliases for columns - outside the () of the derived table. In the example derived table below, the alias ProdCats is provided external to the query (outside the parentheses). Other elements such as Category as defined as internal aliases. SELECT Category, COUNT(ProductID) AS Products FROM (SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name AS Product, c.Name AS Category FROM SalesLT.Product AS p JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID) AS ProdCats GROUP BY Category ORDER BY Category; Table 1.81: Displaying records 1 - 10 Category Products Bib-Shorts 3 Bike Racks 1 Bike Stands 1 Bottles and Cages 3 Bottom Brackets 3 Brakes 2 Caps 1 Chains 1 Cleaners 1 Cranksets 3 1.7.5 Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) Similar to a TVF before we are defining a temporary table object which is used within the scope of the query. But this time aorund we define the CTE first, then make calls to that CTE afterwards. Unlike a derived query however, you can refer to the CTE mutiple times within the same query/code batch, but it won’t live on like a view. We can also use a CTE for recursive elements like loops, so you might want to get everyone within a management tier, then say you want to go through that process three times for the top 3 levels, using the OPTION(MAXRECURSION 3). So in the following example, we first define the CTE, then we make reference to it. The result here is the same as our derived query previously, but perhaps a little easiter to understand. WITH ProductsByCategory (ProductID, ProductName, Category) AS ( SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name, c.Name AS Category FROM SalesLT.Product AS p JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID ) SELECT Category, COUNT(ProductID) AS Products FROM ProductsByCategory GROUP BY Category ORDER BY Category; Table 1.82: Displaying records 1 - 10 Category Products Bib-Shorts 3 Bike Racks 1 Bike Stands 1 Bottles and Cages 3 Bottom Brackets 3 Brakes 2 Caps 1 Chains 1 Cleaners 1 Cranksets 3 Next we will look at the our organisation chart example as previously mentioned. First let’s look at our employee table. SELECT * FROM SalesLT.Employee Table 1.83: 9 records EmployeeID EmployeeName ManagerID 1 adventure-works8 8 2 adventure-works1 1 3 adventure-works0 NA 4 adventure-works0 3 5 adventure-works1 1 6 adventure-works3 3 7 adventure-works9 9 8 adventure-works0 3 9 adventure-works0 3 We can see that each employee has a manager ID apart from Employee 3 who is the CEO/MD. So we have a hierarchy of employees. We will go 3 levels deep this time (three recursions). WITH OrgReport (ManagerID, EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Level) AS ( -- Anchor query SELECT e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeID, EmployeeName, 0 FROM SalesLT.Employee AS e WHERE ManagerID IS NULL UNION ALL -- Recursive query SELECT e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, Level + 1 FROM SalesLT.Employee AS e INNER JOIN OrgReport AS o ON e.ManagerID = o.EmployeeID ) SELECT * FROM OrgReport OPTION (MAXRECURSION 3); Table 1.84: 9 records ManagerID EmployeeID EmployeeName Level NA 3 adventure-works0 0 3 4 adventure-works0 1 3 6 adventure-works3 1 3 8 adventure-works0 1 3 9 adventure-works0 1 9 7 adventure-works9 2 8 1 adventure-works8 2 1 2 adventure-works1 3 1 5 adventure-works1 3 Key Points A derived table is a subquery that generates a multicolumn rowset. You must use the AS clause to define an alias for a derived query. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) provide a more intuitive syntax or defining rowsets than derived tables, and can be used mulitple times in the same query. You can use CTEs to define recursive queries. 1.7.6 Lab Exercises AdventureWorks sells many products that are variants of the same product model. You must write queries that retrieve information about these products. Retrieve the product ID, product name, product model name, and product model summary for each product from the SalesLT.Product table and the SalesLT.vProductModelCatalogDescription view. SELECT P.ProductID, P.Name AS ProductName, PM.Name AS ProductModel, PM.Summary FROM SalesLT.Product AS P JOIN SalesLT.vProductModelCatalogDescription AS PM ON P.ProductModelID = PM.ProductModelID ORDER BY ProductID; Table 1.85: Displaying records 1 - 10 ProductID ProductName ProductModel Summary 749 Road-150 Red, 62 Road-150 This bike is ridden by race winners.

Create a table variable and populate it with a list of distinct colors from the SalesLT.Product table. Then use the table variable to filter a query that returns the product ID, name, and color from the SalesLT.Product table so that only products with a color listed in the table variable are returned. DECLARE @Colors AS TABLE (Color NVARCHAR(15)); INSERT INTO @Colors SELECT DISTINCT Color FROM SalesLT.Product; SELECT ProductID, Name, Color FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE Color IN (SELECT Color FROM @Colors); The AdventureWorksLT database includes a table-valued function named dbo.ufnGetAllCategories, which returns a table of product categories (e.g. ‘Road Bikes’) and parent categories (for example ‘Bikes’). Write a query that uses this function to return a list of all products including their parent category and their own category. SELECT C.ParentProductCategoryName AS ParentCategory, C.ProductCategoryName AS Category, P.ProductID, P.Name AS ProductName FROM SalesLT.Product AS P JOIN dbo.ufnGetAllCategories() AS C ON P.ProductCategoryID = C.ProductCategoryID ORDER BY ParentCategory, Category, ProductName; Table 1.86: Displaying records 1 - 10 ParentCategory Category ProductID ProductName Accessories Bike Racks 876 Hitch Rack - 4-Bike Accessories Bike Stands 879 All-Purpose Bike Stand Accessories Bottles and Cages 871 Mountain Bottle Cage Accessories Bottles and Cages 872 Road Bottle Cage Accessories Bottles and Cages 870 Water Bottle - 30 oz.

You must create queries that return the total revenue for each customer, including the company and customer contact names. Retrieve a list of customers in the format Company (Contact Name) together with the total revenue for each customer. Use a derived table or a common table expression to retrieve the details for each sales order, and then query the derived table or CTE to aggregate and group the data. SELECT CompanyContact, SUM(SalesAmount) AS Revenue FROM (SELECT CONCAT(c.CompanyName, CONCAT(&#39; (&#39; + c.FirstName + &#39; &#39;, c.LastName + &#39;)&#39;)), SOH.TotalDue FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH JOIN SalesLT.Customer AS c ON SOH.CustomerID = c.CustomerID) AS CustomerSales(CompanyContact, SalesAmount) GROUP BY CompanyContact ORDER BY CompanyContact; Table 1.87: Displaying records 1 - 10 CompanyContact Revenue Action Bicycle Specialists (Terry Eminhizer) 119960.8240 Aerobic Exercise Company (Rosmarie Carroll) 2361.6403 Bulk Discount Store (Christopher Beck) 98138.2131 Central Bicycle Specialists (Janeth Esteves) 43.0437 Channel Outlet (Richard Byham) 608.1766 Closest Bicycle Store (Pamala Kotc) 39531.6085 Coalition Bike Company (Donald Blanton) 2669.3183 Discount Tours (Melissa Marple) 3293.7761 Eastside Department Store (Kevin Liu) 92663.5609 Engineered Bike Systems (Joseph Mitzner) 3754.9733 1.8 Grouping Sets and Pivoting Data These are both ways of summarising data - grouping data includes cubing the data. Grouping sets allows you to define multiple groupings within the same query. So you may haved a number of subtotals for different product types, then a total of all the subtotals combined. So you would have something like SELECT FROM GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( , () – empty parentheses if aggregating all rows ) A result line will appear with NULLs in all column(s) which is the grand total. There are other ways to aggregate the data such as ROLLUP and CUBE. ROLLUP is useful if you haave hierarchy - people in households, towns in regions. Cube will show every possible aggregation, rather than specifying each aggregation. Both are specified in the GROUP BY X () where x is either ROLLUP or CUBE. You can add in GROUPING_ID AS fiels to make the interpretation easier when using multiple grouping columns. You can then see the grand total more easily, since it will have a 1 in each groupid column. So a usual group by might look something like this - with a high level Parent Category followed by a Product Category and a count of items. SELECT cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName, count(prd.ProductID) AS Products FROM SalesLT.vGetAllCategories as cat LEFT JOIN SalesLT.Product AS prd ON prd.ProductCategoryID = cat.ProductcategoryID GROUP BY cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName ORDER BY cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName; Table 1.88: Displaying records 1 - 10 ParentProductCategoryName ProductCategoryName Products Accessories Bike Racks 1 Accessories Bike Stands 1 Accessories Bottles and Cages 3 Accessories Cleaners 1 Accessories Fenders 1 Accessories Helmets 3 Accessories Hydration Packs 1 Accessories Lights 3 Accessories Locks 1 Accessories Panniers 1 Here there are no grand total by parent categories. Also, there might be certain items appear in more than one category without totals e.g. bike racks might be in mutiple parent categories. Alternatively, we might create GROUPING SETS which also allows us to create totals.

But we have no loss some of the relationships with parent categories with this query. It is possible to write a query where these things might appear, GROUPING SETS is the most flexible of the grouping commands, but it might be easier to use one of the other grouping options as required, next shows the the ROLLUP command. SELECT cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName, count(prd.ProductID) AS Products FROM SalesLT.vGetAllCategories as cat LEFT JOIN SalesLT.Product AS prd ON prd.ProductCategoryID = cat.ProductcategoryID GROUP BY ROLLUP (cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName) ORDER BY cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName; Table 1.90: Displaying records 1 - 10 ParentProductCategoryName ProductCategoryName Products NA NA 295 Accessories NA 29 Accessories Bike Racks 1 Accessories Bike Stands 1 Accessories Bottles and Cages 3 Accessories Cleaners 1 Accessories Fenders 1 Accessories Helmets 3 Accessories Hydration Packs 1 Accessories Lights 3 It is now giving us totals for parents and products. However, we are now missing situations where items might appear in more than one parent category e.g. bottles and cages that are in a category other than accessories. So we can use CUBE to get these other aggregation options, which will give us all possible aggregations. SELECT cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName, count(prd.ProductID) AS Products FROM SalesLT.vGetAllCategories as cat LEFT JOIN SalesLT.Product AS prd ON prd.ProductCategoryID = cat.ProductcategoryID GROUP BY CUBE (cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName) ORDER BY cat.ParentProductCategoryName, cat.ProductCategoryName; Table 1.91: Displaying records 1 - 10 ParentProductCategoryName ProductCategoryName Products NA NA 295 NA Bib-Shorts 3 NA Bike Racks 1 NA Bike Stands 1 NA Bottles and Cages 3 NA Bottom Brackets 3 NA Brakes 2 NA Caps 1 NA Chains 1 NA Cleaners 1 Key Points * Use GROUPING SETS to define custom groupings. * Use ROLLUP to include subtotals and a grand total for hierarchical groupings. * Use CUBE to include all possible groupings. 1.8.1 Pivoting Data Pivoting is another form of summarising data. We take row based items and pivot them in to single, summarised, columns in a new table. We simply use the PIVOT command. It is possible to undue this using UNPIVOT however this may loose some of the detail that existed in the original data. For instance line level data, such as which particular clothing items were purchased and at which value, is now lost as we just get a clothing total, but re-orientated to match the original data format. We might want to be able to see the totals by colour in our data and by cateory. You have to know which columns you wish to create using the PIVOT table, for instance in the code below we are listing the actual colours our in the PIVOT command. If one colour was missed, the query would work, but you obviously wouldn’t get that colour returned or inlcuded in totals. SELECT * FROM (SELECT P.ProductID, PC.Name,ISNULL(P.Color, &#39;Uncolored&#39;) AS Color FROM saleslt.productcategory AS PC JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P ON PC.ProductCategoryID=P.ProductCategoryID ) AS PPC PIVOT(COUNT(ProductID) FOR Color IN([Red],[Blue],[Black],[Silver],[Yellow],[Grey], [Multi], [Uncolored])) as pvt ORDER BY Name; Table 1.92: Displaying records 1 - 10 Name Red Blue Black Silver Yellow Grey Multi Uncolored Bib-Shorts 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 Bike Racks 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Bike Stands 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Bottles and Cages 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 Bottom Brackets 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 Brakes 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 Caps 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Chains 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 Cleaners 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Cranksets 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 If we wanted to, we could copy/archive this in to a new table, which can be re-used again or compared and retrieved in the future. CREATE TABLE #ProductColorPivot (Name varchar(50), Red int, Blue int, Black int, Silver int, Yellow int, Grey int , multi int, uncolored int); INSERT INTO #ProductColorPivot SELECT * FROM (SELECT P.ProductID, PC.Name,ISNULL(P.Color, &#39;Uncolored&#39;) AS Color FROM saleslt.productcategory AS PC JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P ON PC.ProductCategoryID=P.ProductCategoryID ) AS PPC PIVOT(COUNT(ProductID) FOR Color IN([Red],[Blue],[Black],[Silver],[Yellow],[Grey], [Multi], [Uncolored])) as pvt ORDER BY Name; If we then wanted to unpvivot the data we would do so as follows. SELECT Name, Color, ProductCount FROM (SELECT Name, [Red],[Blue],[Black],[Silver],[Yellow],[Grey], [Multi], [Uncolored] FROM #ProductColorPivot) pcp UNPIVOT (ProductCount FOR Color IN ([Red],[Blue],[Black],[Silver],[Yellow],[Grey], [Multi], [Uncolored]) ) AS ProductCounts Key Points * Use PIVOT to re-orient a rowset by generating mulitple columns from values in a single column. * Use UNPIVOT to re-orient mulitple columns in a an existing rowset into a single column. 1.8.2 Lab Exercises AdventureWorks sells products to customers in multiple country/regions around the world. An existing report uses the query provided in the editor to return total sales revenue grouped by country/region and state/province.

AdventureWorks customers are retail companies, and they may place orders for products of any category. The revenue for each product in an order is recorded as the LineTotal value in the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table. Retrieve a list of customer company names together with their total revenue for each parent category in Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, and Components. Make sure to use the aliases provided, and default column names elsewhere.

To add data we use the INSERT … VALUES command, where you can leave blank columns that allow NULLs and cols with default constraints. You can also leave identify/primary key fields blank since they will be generated automatically, depending on what seed and increment values were specified when the table was set up, however it is possible to overide these values if you wish. You can add a NULL value to a column if you wish. You can also insert the results of another query in to an existing table using INSERT … SELECT or INSERT … EXEC where EXEC is the execution of a stored query. Another option is SELECT … INTO will explicity create a new table, inserting data based on query. However this newly created table will not have contraints, defaults, indexes or primary keys, just a set of columns with the results of the query. This is currently not supported in Azure, however you could create the table first with the items needed such as columns and pk, then use the INSERT INTO for Azure. Our Identity property of a column generates sequential numbers for insertations of new data into a database and we can set the parameters of this identity column. If you insert a new item (row) in to a table, you might want to then get back this identity column for this new item e.g. you automatically generate a new sales ID but a new order, however you might want to then present this back to the customer, this is acheived using @(???), but this returns the last identity referenced, so if you are adding the sales order first then the individual items in a seperate table, it will retrieve the idenity column from the sales order details rather than sales order header. This command therefore returns the last identity from the current connected session. An alternative is to use SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY() AS ORDERID which wil bring back the last identity column for the specified table in the current session, but again this can be problematic. The alternative is to use IDENT_CURRENT(’) which passes the last identity inserted into a particular table, however this is across all sessions, so if others are inserting the table this can be problematic. So generally the best option is to use SCOPE_IDENTITY and present that, before then going on to do other things. If you perhaps wanted to have two different tables for two different order types - say in store purchases and online purchases as two dinstinct tables - but to both use the same sequential list for order ID, you could do this using sequences. They exist independently of tables so can be referenced by mutiple tables, the query will ask the server what the next id is in the sequence and be provided with that. It is like a central store that issues new numbers on request. So to create a new table for customer call logs we do the following: CREATE TABLE SalesLT.CallLog ( CallID int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, -- no seed or increment set, so will start at 1 then add 1 CallTime datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(), -- if not date and time set, it will get the current date and time SalesPerson nvarchar(256) NOT NULL, CustomerID int NOT NULL REFERENCES SalesLT.Customer(CustomerID), -- references a foreign key from the customer table PhoneNumber nvarchar(25) NOT NULL, Notes nvarchar(max) NULL -- the only column which is allowed to be NULL, since perhaps the customer does not answer ); GO If we then wanted to explicitly add or insert a row in to the datbase we do the following - note the CallID does not need to be given since this is automatically created : – INT is optional, we state values as we are explicitly stating the values INSERT INTO SalesLT.CallLog VALUES (&#39;2015-01-01T12:30:00&#39;, &#39;adventure-works\\pamela0&#39;, 1, &#39;245-555-0173&#39;, &#39;Returning call re: enquiry about delivery&#39;); If we wantedc to accept the default options, we can do that by using DEFAULT (e.g. for data/time) and if there are no notes we can use NULL. INSERT INTO SalesLT.CallLog VALUES (DEFAULT, &#39;adventure-works\\david8&#39;, 2, &#39;170-555-0127&#39;, NULL); Perhaps we need to re-order our fields rather than accepting the default sequence, perhaps it is a modified table or a table form another source. To do this, we explicitly state the columns. INSERT INTO SalesLT.CallLog (SalesPerson, CustomerID, PhoneNumber) VALUES (&#39;adventure-works\\jillian0&#39;, 3, &#39;279-555-0130&#39;); If we wanted to add two records, we can do this at the same time, and even use some different options for the different rows. INSERT INTO SalesLT.CallLog VALUES (DATEADD(mi,-2, GETDATE()), &#39;adventure-works\\jillian0&#39;, 4, &#39;710-555-0173&#39;, NULL), (DEFAULT, &#39;adventure-works\\shu0&#39;, 5, &#39;828-555-0186&#39;, &#39;Called to arrange deliver of order 10987&#39;); There are more examples with adding query results into tables and getting identity values in the demo files. Key Points * Use the INSERT statement to insert one or more rows into a table. * When inserting explicit values, you can omit identity columns, columns that allow NULLs, and columns on which a default constraint is defined. * Identity columns generate a unique integer identifier for each row. You can also use a sequence to generate unique values that can be used in multiple tables. "]
