## Principles of Data Science

The course uses the following definition of data science:

> Data Science is the exploration and quantitative analysis of all available structured and unstructured data to develop understanding, extract knowledge, and formulate actionable results.

We are interested in 'Data Analytical Thinking' which effectivley moves us away from intution to data driven analytical decisions.  Originally data was used to inform decisions, however advances have made analysis to be more real time e.g. prescriptive analytics, and also help consider future trends i.e. predictive analytics.

For instance in a medical sense, we no longer wait for a patient to present themselves, we can take more regular readings such as blood tests, surveys and so on, then identify which patients are more at risk and undertake preventive work.  In a similar way, aircraft manufacturers are building in measurement devices and applications to record data and report it, so that abnormal part behaviour is picked up earlier leading to preventative maintenance.  Equally in fraud detection, we can now look not just at real time transactions which look odd, but anomolies across multiple accounts which may indicate large scale fraud using anomaly detection.

There is some terminology to learn, for instance if we were looking at whether a crime had been predicted by the same person, we might call that a crime series:

* Crime Series = Cluster in ML  
* Modus Operandi = Subspace in ML  

Whilst the actual process is a bit more detailed, but the method used to detect this wasn't far off k-means clustering.

Big Data was originally called this by a pair of Astronomers who also suggested a data pipeline.

```{r Big Data Pipeline, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Big Data Pipeline'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DSEssentials/Pipeline.png")
```

At the same time, a seperate group were trying to create a representation for the knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process.

```{r KDD, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Knowledge Discovery in Databases or KDD'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DSEssentials/KDD.png")
```

So they have the same exact steps, which suggests at some commonality between fields in terms of data and knowledge discovery.  Data Mining is only one part of the process.  CRISP-DM is a similar process, but also includes Business Need and Data Understanding.  As the diagrams indicate, there are backwards flows, indicating we move in an iterative process.

```{r CRISP-DM, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='CRISP-DM'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DSEssentials/CRISP-DM.png")
```

Part of the data preperation process can involve turning things like unstructured text in to something more useable for ML i.e. a vector.  People often thinking the modelling step is where the 'magic' happens, but if the data has been properly prepared, then it will be quite straightforward.

Predictive modelling means machine learning or statistical modelling, it may not mean predicting the future, it can often mean predicting a new case or person outcome that you have not seen before.
