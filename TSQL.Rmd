## Introduction to Transact-SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language was first developed in the 1970s by IBM as a way of interacting with databases. Other vendors have specfic versions of SQL for instance Oracle is PL/SQL, Microsoft's implentation is TSQL or Transact SQL.  Both SQL Server (on prem) and Azure SQL Databases (cloud) use the same query language, however Azure is a subset of full TSQL since it some commands relate to local files and data functions within .NET that relate only to SQL Server.  However, as new features are added to Azure, some new commands are being added to Azure. 

SQL is a declarative language - you express what it is that you want, the results - rather than specifying the steps taken to acheive that - it is not prodecural like other programming languages, it is set theory based.  It is possible to write proceedural elements or steps within TSQL, however if this is ocurring a lot, it is perhaps better done in another language, which may also perform or run better.  

In databases, we typically talk about entities - one type of thing - which is contained in each table.  
* Entities are represented as relations (tables) 
* And entity attributes as domains (columns)

Most relationships are normalized, with relationships between primary and foreign keys.  This helps to reduce duplication, however there are instances where de-normalised data is desired.  

Schemas are namespaces for database objects - is shows a logical layout for all or part of a relational database, _"As part of a data dictionary, a database schema indicates how the entities that make up the database relate to one another, including tables, views, stored procedures, and more."_(see [Lucid Chart on Database Schemas](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/database-diagram/database-schema)).  The process of creating a database schema is called data modelling.  

When referring to objects in a database, we could use a fully qualified name, such as:

* [server_name.][database_name.][schema_name.]object_name

This is only really relevant for SQL Server, since Azure will only work with one database at a time.  Most of the time we typically just use

* schema_name.object_name

The schema name somwtimes be discarded, but it is considered best practice to include this, since there is sometimes some ambiguity about tables e.g. if we have two tables - Product.Order and Customer.Order  - which order table is being referred to, that in the customer or product schema?

SQL has a number of SQL Statement Types:

* DML or Data Manipulation Language - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
* DDL or Data Definition Language - CREATE, ALTER, DROP
* DCL or Data Control Language - GRANT, REVOKE, DENY

The course focuses on DML which is typically for working with data.  

**SELECT** statement has a number of possible sub-components:

* FROM [table]
* WHERE [condition for filtering rows]
* GROUP BY [arranges rows by groups]
* HAVING [condition for filtering groups]
* ORDER BY [sorts the output]

Whilst a SQL statement can look like English, it doesn't neccessarily run from top to bottom in terms of the sequence of elements that are run in a query.  For instance, the FROM is the first thing that will be run, then the WHERE filter will be run, then we GROUP BY, then  SELECT the columns we are interested in and finally ORDER the results.  This can be important when running some queries, which will be explored later in the course.  When we run a query, it is not an actual table in a database that is return but a set of rows or record set or subset.

### Data Types

There are a number of different data types in T-SQL as shown below, which are grouped in to a number of different types.  

```{r Data Types, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Transact-SQL Data Types'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TSQL/TSQLDataTypes.png")
```

This is more relevant when designing a database, however it is useful to know when querying what data type you have in a broad sense - numeric, data, string and so on - as the types will determine what type of combinations can be combined together in expressions  e.g. you can concatenate strings or add numbers together, but you can't concatenate a string and a number together. 

Sometimes it is neccessary to convert data from one type to another, there are two ways this could happen

* Implicit conversion - compatible data types are automatically converted 
* Explicit conversion - requires an explicit function e.g. CAST / TRY_CAST, STR, PARSE ? TRY_PARSE, CONVERT / TRY_CONVERT

The TRY options will attempt a conversion and if it does not work, a NULL will be returned rather than an error in the non-TRY version.   

### Working with NULLs

There are recognised standards for treating NULL values - ANSI - which says that anythign involving a NULL should return a NULL.  There are functions that help us handle NULL values:

* ISNULL(column/variable, value) - Returns _value_ (which you can specify) if the column or variable is NULL
* NULLIF(column/variable, value) - Returns NULL if the column or variable is a value - we are almost recoding a non-null to a null
* COALESCE (column/variable1, column/variable2, ...) - Returns the value of the first non-NULL column or variable in the list - for instance if contact details, someone might not have an email, so we might want a telephone number, if they don't have that, return an address etc

NULL is used to indicate an unknown or missing value. NULL is **not** equivalent to zero or an empty string.

ISNULL can be used like an IF function in excel, for instance:

> SELECT name, ISNULL(TRY_CAST(size AS Integer), 0) AS NumericSize  
  FROM SalesLT.Product;

In this instance, if there is a value that will be returned, if not, the NULL value will be returned as a 0.  

We can also use a CASE statement to return a value whilst integrating NULL in to our query, e.g.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT name,  
    CASE size  
      WHEN 'S' THEN 'SMALL'  
      WHEN 'M' THEN 'MEDIUM'  
      WHEN 'L' THEN 'LARGE'  
      WHEN 'XL' THEN 'EXTRA LARGE'  
      ELSE ISNULL(Size, 'N/A')  
    END AS PRODUCT  
  FROM SalesLT.Product; 
```

### Lab Exercises

AdventureWorks Cycles is a company that sells directly to retailers, who then sell products to consumers. Each retailer that is an AdventureWorks customer has provided a named contact for all communication from AdventureWorks.

The sales manager at AdventureWorks has asked you to generate some reports containing details of the company's customers to support a direct sales campaign. Let's start with some basic exploration.

First we display the sales person, the customer's title, surname and telephone number

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesPerson, Title + ' ' + LastName AS CustomerName, Phone
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

Next we cast the CustomerID column to a VARCHAR and concatenate with the CompanyName column

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) + ': ' + CompanyName AS CustomerCompany
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

The SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table contains records of sales orders. You have been asked to retrieve data for a report that shows:

The sales order number and revision number in the format <Order Number> (<Revision>) (e.g. SO71774 (2)).
The order date converted to ANSI standard format yyyy.mm.dd (e.g. 2015.01.31).

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesOrderNumber + ' (' + STR(RevisionNumber, 1) + ')' AS OrderRevision,
	   CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), OrderDate, 102) AS OrderDate
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;
```

Next we write a query that returns a list of customer names.  We use ISNULL to check for middle names and concatenate with FirstName and LastName.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + ISNULL(MiddleName + ' ', '') + LastName
AS CustomerName
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

Next, we will imagine that some data has been deleted - customer email addresses - then we try to find contact details in sequence.  

```{sql connection=con}
UPDATE SalesLT.Customer
SET EmailAddress = NULL
WHERE CustomerID % 7 = 1;
```

Next we write a query that returns a list of customer IDs in one column, and a second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if known, and otherwise the phone number.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT CustomerID, COALESCE(EmailAddress, Phone) AS PrimaryContact
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

You have been asked to create a query that returns a list of sales order IDs and order dates with a column named ShippingStatus that contains the text "Shipped" for orders with a known ship date, and "Awaiting Shipment" for orders with no ship date.

Again, we imagine that some data is missing by deleting some first.

```{sql connection=con}
UPDATE SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
SET ShipDate = NULL
WHERE SalesOrderID > 71899;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate,
  CASE
    WHEN ShipDate IS NULL THEN 'Awaiting Shipment'
    ELSE 'Shipped'
  END AS ShippingStatus
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;
```

## Querying Tables with SELECT

### Removing Duplicates

If we wanted to know what colours our products are, we would run something like the following.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Color
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Here each product has a row and corresponding colour.  However, if we just want colour, we are typically interested in removing duplicates to just show what colours we are actually producing.  This is achieve using the DISTINCT keyword

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT Color
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

These results are DISTINCT at the row level, so if we have two combinitions of columns - say size and colour - then it would be DISTINCT colour and size combinations that appear in the database.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT Color, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Here is just the size - here IS NULL will return a 'None' if the Size is missing (NA).

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT ISNULL(Size, 'None') AS Size
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```


### Sorting Results

ORDER By is how we sort the results.  Any aliased fields used in the SELECT element are visible by ORDER BY.  You can oder the results using columns that are not selected in the SELECT clause.  You can also ORDER BY multiple columns, either ascending or descending.

We can also just show the top 10 products, e.g. the top 10 most expensive.  This is done using the keywork TOP

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT TOP (10) ProductCategoryID AS Category, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY ListPrice DESC, Category;
```

We can also use TOP (N) Percent or TOP (N) WITH TIES.  If we say wanted the bottom 10 items - say those with the lowest price - there is no 'BOTTOM' Keyword, instead we would sort our data so that they are now in the the order we want - with those we are interested at the top - the use TOP again.  

### Paging through results

This is achieved through using the OFFSET-FETCH which is an extension of ORDER BY.  This might be useful if you have a set of web page results and you want to see certain ones.  

You first say how many rows you want to skip using e.g. OFFSET 10 ROWS, then use specify how many rows you are interested in retrieving from the database e.g. FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY.

### Filtering and Using Predicates

We can use the WHERE clause with a number of coniditions or predicates.  For instance = (equals) <> (not equals), IN, BETWEEN (is an inclusive statement e.g. BETWEEN 100 AND 200 includes 100 and 200), LIKE,  AND, OR and NOT.  IN can be more efficient in coding terms when testing multiple attributes, as you just say color IN (red, blue) rather than colour  = 'red' OR colour = 'blue'.  This becomes more useful when testing multiple conditions e.g. IN (red, blue) AND size = large - this would have more typing with explicit code for each combition.

Like mathematics, SQL works on PEMDAS sequencing - parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.  

Some examples.

First look for products that start with an FR:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'FR%';
```

Or we can look for products that end in a 58:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE '%58';
```

Or we can use underscores to specify a number of charecters e.g. one _ is one missing charecter.  A wildcard (%) would match any number of chars.  The figures in brackets then are like regex, so if we want a numeric value between 0 and 9 we use [0-9].  Equally we could use a similar query to find things like email addresses in a string, or email addresses that end in a .co.uk.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-_[0-9][0-9]_-[0-9][0-9]';
```

We can use the BETWEEN clause on things like dates to select all products that were removed from sale in 2016:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name
FROM SalesLT.Product 
WHERE SellEndDate BETWEEN '2006/1/1' AND '2006/12/31';
```

Note that it is often useful to order results in the order you want, even if it currently appears it the correct order.  Sometimes these queries may change as data or the database does, so it is best to be explicit and use an ORDER BY.  

### Lab Exercises

You are being told that transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the top 10 percent from the Name column
SELECT TOP (10) Percent Name, Weight
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- order by the weight in descending order
ORDER BY Weight DESC;
```

Next, we want to ignore the first 10 records - to page through using offset

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY Weight DESC
-- offset 10 rows and get the next 100
OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS ONLY;
```

Next we create a query to find the names, colors, and sizes of the products with a product model ID of 1.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the Name, Color, and Size columns
SELECT Name, Color, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- check ProductModelID is 1
WHERE ProductModelID = 1;
```

Now we would like more information on products of certain colors and sizes.  We retrieve the product number and name of the products that have a Color of 'Black', 'Red', or 'White' and a Size of 'S' or 'M'.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the ProductNumber and Name columns
SELECT ProductNumber, Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- check that Color is one of 'Black', 'Red' or 'White'
-- check that Size is one of 'S' or 'M'
WHERE Color IN ('Black', 'Red', 'White') AND Size IN ('S', 'M');
```

Next you have been asked to retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products that have a product number beginning with 'BK-'.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the ProductNumber, Name, and ListPrice columns
SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- filter for product numbers beginning with BK- using LIKE
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-%';
```

Finally, the product manager is interested in a slight variation of the last request regarding product numbers with a particular prefix.

We are interested in products with product number beginning with 'BK-' followed by any character other than 'R', and ending with a '-' followed by any two numerals.  Not an R is [^R].

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the ProductNumber, Name, and ListPrice columns
SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- filter for ProductNumbers
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-[^R]%-[0-9][0-9]';
```

## Querying Tables with Joins

We usually join tables based on primary key - foreign key relationships.  We don't run two queries then join, but match at the time of the query.  When we are talking about joins, we typically represent them as Venn diagrams.  

The convention (ANSI SQL-92) is to specify the JOIN operator in the FROM clause:

> SELECT ...
  FROM Table1 JOIN Table 2
  ON <on_predicate>;
  
There is an older standard (ANSI SQL-89) where the tables are joined using commas in the FROM clause and using a WHERE operator, but this can lead to accidental cartesian (aka cross) products.

### INNER Joins

INNER Joins are typically the most common join type.  It involves a join only where a match is found in both input tables.  You can add multiple joins after each other.

Some examples - first a basic inner join where the schema, table and column are explicitly stated. 

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesLT.Product.Name AS ProductName, SalesLT.ProductCategory.Name AS Category
FROM SalesLT.Product
INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory
ON SalesLT.Product.ProductCategoryID = SalesLT.ProductCategory.ProductCategoryID;
```

Next, we can do the same query but make this less cumbersome by using table aliases.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT p.Name AS ProductName, c.Name AS Category
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c
on p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID;
```

Next, we look at joining multiple tables, where we want the sales, including order level details, the products in the order and the product details.  If we don't specify the join type, the assumption is it is a INNER join, as shown below.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderNumber, p.Name As ProductName, od.OrderQty, od.UnitPrice, od.LineTotal
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
ORDER BY oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderID, od.SalesOrderDetailID;
```

It is possible to do joins based on more than one criteria, e.g. we could join based on the productID and where the ListPrice is less than the unitprice i.e. there has been a discount.

```{sql connection=con}
-- Multiple join predicates
SELECT oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderNumber, p.Name As ProductName, od.OrderQty, od.UnitPrice, od.LineTotal
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND od.UnitPrice < p.ListPrice --Note multiple predicates
ORDER BY oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderID, od.SalesOrderDetailID; 
```

### OUTER Joins

In an outer join we return all the rows from one table, and any matching rows from the second table.  The records in the 'outer' table are preserved, typically we use language such as LEFT, RIGHT and FULL keywords.  We are pulling in records from that OUTER table.  FULL keeps records from both tables, but are typically not seen in practice.  OUTER is OPTIONAL e.g. LEFT JOIN is the same as LEFT OUTER JOIN.  

Now some examples.  First, we bring up a list of customers, with any matching sales records i.e. we have a list of customers who HAVE bought someting and those WHO HAVE NOT.  

```{sql connection=con}
--Get all customers, with sales orders for those who've bought anything
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
ORDER BY c.CustomerID;
```

Next we can look just for those customers who have not purchased anything using IS NULL.

```{sql connection=con}
--Return only customers who haven't purchased anything
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
WHERE oh.SalesOrderNumber IS NULL 
ORDER BY c.CustomerID;
```

Next we add records from multiple tables.  If we add tables on to the chain of tables, having first decleared a left or right join, you have to keep using LEFT joins.  You could use an INNER Join but you would loose some records e.g. if you used an INNER join on the second table below, you would loose those records (products) that had never been sold.  

Sometimes it is neccessary to go through one table to get to another e.g. to Products -> Orders requires going through order details first. Even if, we are not brining back any tables from the intermediary table.

```{sql connection=con}
--More than 2 tables
SELECT p.Name As ProductName, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh --Additional tables added to the right must also use a left join
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
ORDER BY p.ProductID;
```

Next another example with multiple tables, but this time the order of the tables is different.  We SELECT from the product table, then we LEFT Join the Order details so we can identify products that have never sold, then we LEFT JOIN to the order header table so we can get the order number where we use a left outer join as we are left joining those records to our original table.  Then we INNER Join product category, because we are joining product category back to the first table - Products.  The final table joins back to our original table, before the outer joins.  So whether you need to use an OUTER or INNER join depends on where you wish to place the records based on the current list of tables, however you could reorder the tables to do it differently e.g. do the INNER JOIN first, then then LEFT JOINS.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT p.Name As ProductName, c.Name AS Category, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c --Added to the left, so can use inner join
ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID
ORDER BY p.ProductID;
```

** Key Points** 

* Use a Left Outer Join to include all rows from the first table and values from matched rows in the second table. Columns in the second table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.
* Use a Right Outer Join to include all rows from the second table and values from matched rows in the first table. Columns in the first table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.
* Use a Full Outer Join to include all rows from the first and second tables. Columns in the either table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.

### Cross Joins

Cross Joins create caretesian products - they combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table - to give all possible combinations of products.

One example of it being used would be if we have a list of staff with their attributes, we might want to compare them to the attributes required for all jobs to see which they match, perhaps as an internal job search.  Another example is if we have two list of addresses and we calculate the edit distance between the two addresses from the different sources, to try and match those addresses.  We would rank the addresses based on their edit distance, with those scoring highest the closest and most likely to be the same address.  It can be used to generate test data also.  

An example

```{sql connection=con}
--Call each customer once per product - perhaps not the most realistic example!
SELECT p.Name, c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Phone
FROM SalesLT.Product as p
CROSS JOIN SalesLT.Customer as c;
```

### Self Joins

You might want to join data on to itself but in a different sequence.  For instance, we might want to join a person's manager on to their employee(s), but managers are also employees, so this would be a self join.  We would use aliases for the table names as we have the same table twice.  So when defining a self-join, you must specify an alias for at least one instance of the table being joined.

So our original table looks like this:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM SalesLT.Employee;
```
Then the actual self join query - we use a left join as some people i.e. the CEO, will not have a manager.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT e.EmployeeName, m.EmployeeName AS ManagerName
FROM SalesLT.Employee AS e
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.Employee AS m
ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
ORDER BY e.ManagerID;
```

### Lab Session

Write a query that returns the company name from the Sale.Customer table, the sales order ID and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table. 

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the CompanyName, SalesOrderId, and TotalDue columns from the appropriate tables
SELECT c.CompanyName, oh.SalesOrderId, oh.TotalDue
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
-- join tables based on CustomerID
ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID;
```

In order to send out invoices to the customers, we need their addresses.  Extend your customer orders query to include the main office address for each customer, including the full street address, city, state or province, postal code, and country or region. 

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CompanyName, a.AddressLine1, ISNULL(a.AddressLine2, '') AS AddressLine2, a.City, a.StateProvince, a.PostalCode, a.CountryRegion, oh.SalesOrderID, oh.TotalDue
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
-- join the SalesOrderHeader table
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON oh.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
-- join the CustomerAddress table
JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
-- filter for where the AddressType is 'Main Office'
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID AND AddressType = 'Main Office'
JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON ca.AddressID = a.AddressID;
```

The sales manager wants a list of all customer companies and their contacts (first name and last name), showing the sales order ID and total due for each order they have placed.  Customers who have not placed any orders should be included at the bottom of the list with NULL values for the order ID and total due. 

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the CompanyName, FirstName, LastName, SalesOrderID and TotalDue columns
-- from the appropriate tables
SELECT c.CompanyName, c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderID, oh.TotalDue
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
-- join based on CustomerID
ON oh.CustomerID  = c.CustomerID
-- order the SalesOrderIDs from highest to lowest
ORDER BY oh.SalesOrderID DESC;
```

A sales employee has noticed that AdventureWorks does not have address information for all customers.  Write a query that returns a list of customer IDs, company names, contact names (first name and last name), and phone numbers for customers with no address stored in the database. 

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CompanyName, c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Phone
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
-- join based on CustomerID
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
-- filter for when the AddressID doesn't exist
WHERE ca.AddressID IS NULL;
```

Some customers have never placed orders, and some products have never been ordered.

Write a query that returns a column of customer IDs for customers who have never placed an order, and a column of product IDs for products that have never been ordered.

Each row with a customer ID should have a NULL product ID (because the customer has never ordered a product) and each row with a product ID should have a NULL customer ID (because the product has never been ordered by a customer).

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CustomerID, p.ProductID
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
FULL JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
FULL JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
-- join based on the SalesOrderID
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
FULL JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p
-- join based on the ProductID
ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
-- filter for nonexistent SalesOrderIDs
WHERE oh.SalesOrderID IS NULL
ORDER BY ProductID, CustomerID;
```

## Using Set Operators

A union query is unlike a join, where as a join adds more columns, a union typically adds more rows. You put all records from one query on to the records at the end of another query.  NOTE that it is a list of distinct (non duplicate) records - this will be checked every single row in one table and then checks if that record exists across every single row in the other table.  Obviously as more tables are added, checking this can become more time consuming and affects performance.

UNION ALL will not undertake this checking, leading to more performance, but some duplicates. John Smith may appear in the employees table but he may also appear in the customers table.  Sometimes this is the desired result.  In such an instance it makes sense to add a new field using an alias at the time of ther query, such as record type,  so we know where this record occurs.

When using Union:

* It is a good idea to use column aliases, so we know which table the column occurs in.  However, only aliases in the first query are recognised, so any aliases should be set against the first table
* The number of columns must be the same across tables, you can add an additional column but this must be given a specific value or a NULL
* The data types must be approximatley similar i.e. we can do an implicit or explict conversion so they match.

The following example joins the Employees to the customer using Union i.e. removing duplicates.

NOTE: In the following example, views were created (using code provided in the course), before running the queries on the database.  Therefore to reproduce these results, it is neccessary to run that same code (Module 4, Union sql file, in the CourseFiles zip) before the following queries will run on the AdventureWorksLT db.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Employees
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customers
ORDER BY LastName;
```

This gives 440 rows, if however we use UNION ALL

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customers
ORDER BY LastName;
```

This results in 441 rows, so there is 1 row which occurs in both - a Donna Carreras appears both in the customer and emplyee table.  This could be the same person or indeed just someone with the same name. 

It might be useful to know which table the record occurs in, which is where we can introduce a Type column.  Not that after the first alias AS Type, subsequent fields e.g. 'Customer' as shown below do not need to be explicitly aliased, however it can make it easier to understand if we do include the AS Type.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName, LastName, 'Employee' AS Type
FROM SalesLT.Employees
UNION 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, 'Customer' AS Type
FROM SalesLT.Customers
ORDER BY LastName
OFFSET 100 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

Note that even though we have used UNION rather than UNION ALL, this would result in the same number of rows as UNION ALL (441), because the presence of the type column means this is no longer the same person - it is not a duplicate record but a unique one.  However, it is worth using UNION ALL to limit the number of records that have to be checked for duplicates, so improving peformance.

**By default, UNION eliminates duplicate rows. Specify the ALL option to include duplicates (or to avoid the overhead of checking for duplicates when you know in advance that there are none).**

### INTERSECT and EXCEPT Queries

In INTERSECT we look at only rows that appear in each set - we are looking for the duplicates.  Whereas using a JOIN would append columns to the source table, in set theory, we are looking for rows, so in an INTERSECT we are looking for those rows that appear in both datasets.

IN EXCEPT we are looking for records that appear in one source but not the other.  In such a scenario, the order of the tables matters.

If we now try and identify the person who appears in both our datasets, we can identify the person directly.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customers
INTERSECT
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Employees;
```

Next we want to find the EXCEPT - so let's find customers who are not employees, so we don't try and sel products to employees.  There are 104 customers, so we should get 103 rows, as we remove Donna Carreras.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customers
EXCEPT
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Employees;
```

### Lab exercises

Customers can have two kinds of address: a main office address and a shipping address. The accounts department wants to ensure that the main office address is always used for billing, and have asked you to write a query that clearly identifies the different types of address for each customer.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the CompanyName, AddressLine1 columns
-- alias as per the instructions
SELECT CompanyName, AddressLine1, City, 'Billing' AS AddressType
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
-- join based on CustomerID
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
-- join another table
JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
-- join based on AddressID
ON ca.AddressID = a.AddressID
-- filter for where the correct AddressType
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Main Office';
```

Adapt the query to retrieve the company name, first line of the street address, city, and a column named AddressType with the value 'Shipping' for customers where the address type in the SalesLT.CustomerAddress table is 'Shipping'.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CompanyName, a.AddressLine1, a.City, 'Shipping' AS AddressType
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON ca.AddressID = a.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Shipping';
```

Next we can union all these records together to create a list of shipping and billing addresses, using UNION ALL.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CompanyName, a.AddressLine1, a.City, 'Billing' AS AddressType
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON ca.AddressID = a.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Main Office'
-- UNION
UNION ALL
SELECT c.CompanyName, a.AddressLine1, a.City, 'Shipping' AS AddressType
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON ca.AddressID = a.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Shipping'
ORDER BY c.CompanyName
OFFSET 10 ROWS;
```

You have created a master list of all customer addresses, but now you have been asked to create filtered lists that show which customers have only a main office address, and which customers have both a main office and a shipping address.


```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CompanyName
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON a.AddressID = ca.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Main Office' --Filters out shipping addresses.  This is a table of all Billing addresses.
EXCEPT
SELECT c.CompanyName
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON a.AddressID = ca.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Shipping'
ORDER BY c.CompanyName;
```

Or the INTERSECT version to identify the company name of each company that appears in a table of customers with a 'Main Office' address, and also in a table of customers with a 'Shipping' address. 

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.CompanyName
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON a.AddressID = ca.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Main Office' --Filters out shipping addresses.  This is a table of all Billing addresses.
INTERSECT
SELECT c.CompanyName
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID
INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address AS a
ON a.AddressID = ca.AddressID
WHERE ca.AddressType = 'Shipping'
ORDER BY c.CompanyName;
```

## Using Functions and Aggregating Data

Now we are looking to not just bring back individual rows but perform calculations, such as aggregations, on those results.

The functions we will look at are shown below.

```{r Functions, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Transact-SQL Functions'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TSQL/Functions.png")
```

### Scalar Functions

A scalar function returns a single value, not a row or column or table.  In database design things can be deterministic or non-deterministic

* Deterministic - we know what the result will be, assuming the data hasn't changed.  The data going in and coming out will be the same
* Non-deterministic - we cannot gaurantee what the result will be.  For instance if we tested if todays date was less than a value in a table, it would depend on the time and day that the query was run.  We can't say what the result will be, based on the data going in/from the db.

A scalar function can be either deterministic or non-deterministic.  Scalar is a set of functions, and can do multiple things - date and times, text and image, mathematical, system and system statistical, metadata and so on.

We might want to extract the year from a date, for instance to determine when a product was first sold.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT YEAR(SellStartDate) SellStartYear, ProductID, Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY SellStartYear;
```

Other examples might include being able to extract certain parts of the date, like the month or day of the week, this can be achived with the DATENAME function

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT YEAR(SellStartDate) SellStartYear, DATENAME(mm,SellStartDate) SellStartMonth,
       DAY(SellStartDate) SellStartDay, DATENAME(dw, SellStartDate) SellStartWeekday,
	   ProductID, Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY SellStartYear;
```

Or we might want to calculate how long a product has been sold, we can use the DATEDIFF function to work this out.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DATEDIFF(yy,SellStartDate, GETDATE()) YearsSold, 
       DATEDIFF(mm,SellStartDate, GETDATE()) MonthsSold,
       ProductID, Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY ProductID;
```

Another common example might be to convert text to upper case.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT UPPER(Name) AS ProductName
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

We might want to add two strings together but with a space or other text, so we could use the CONCAT function to achieve this.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName + ' ', LastName) AS FullName,
       FirstName, LastName
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

Or we might want to return just a specific number of charecters from a string, perhaps there is a structure in the sequence - like the first two chars relate to a product type - so we want to just extract these first two.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, ProductNumber, LEFT(ProductNumber, 2) AS ProductType
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Or we might have something more complex, where we want to find certain elements of text, we can use CHARINDEX to identify where a char occurs, then combine it with SUBSTRING to extract just a portion of the full string which is n chars before or after a particular charecter.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, ProductNumber, LEFT(ProductNumber, 2) AS ProductType,
                            SUBSTRING(ProductNumber,CHARINDEX('-', ProductNumber) + 1, 4) AS ModelCode,
							              SUBSTRING(ProductNumber, LEN(ProductNumber) - CHARINDEX('-', REVERSE(RIGHT(ProductNumber, 3))) + 2, 2) AS SizeCode
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

### Logical Functions

Logical functions test if someting is true or not i.e. traditional boolean. But we can use logical functions as filters by using CHOOSE for example, you could use IIF which is also a logical, or we could use CASE to achieve the same result.  

An exmaple might be if we want to return some numeric sizes, for instance if we have a table of data with different size formats:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

We might only be interested in those that have a numeric type, even though the data is in a char data string, 1 in this instance means true:
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Size AS NumericSize
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ISNUMERIC(Size) = 1;
```

Or we might want to assign a value to something, like a product type of bike to certain values and other to everything else.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, IIF(ProductCategoryID IN (5,6,7), 'Bike', 'Other') ProductType
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Or a more complicated query where we assign mutiple product types.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT prd.Name AS ProductName, cat.Name AS Category,
      CHOOSE (cat.ParentProductCategoryID, 'Bikes','Components','Clothing','Accessories') AS ProductType
FROM SalesLT.Product AS prd
JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS cat
ON prd.ProductCategoryID = cat.ProductCategoryID;
```

### Window Functions

A window in this context is a set of rows - a window in to the database or table.  For instance, we might want to RANK a set (or window) of data.  The query below will pull out the top 100 more expensive products (ordered by list price) then creates a ranking based on this list price, then orders the results by this ranking.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT TOP(100) ProductID, Name, ListPrice,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ListPrice DESC) AS RankByPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
ORDER BY RankByPrice;
```

Or we might want to partition the results by product category, similar to grouping by product category.  This will result in a ranking for each product category.  The results might look a little odd at first glance.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT c.Name AS Category, p.Name AS Product, ListPrice,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY c.Name ORDER BY ListPrice DESC) AS RankByPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c
ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductcategoryID
ORDER BY Category, RankByPrice;
```

### Aggregate Functions

There are a lot of aggregate functions including some statistical functions like s.d. as well as some more standard things like MIN, MAX, SUM etc over a set of data.  We can use GROUP BY.  

First we can get some headline stats of what is in the table.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Products, COUNT(DISTINCT ProductCategoryID) AS Categories, AVG(ListPrice) AS AveragePrice
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Or we might be interested in summary figures for just one product type, like bikes.  Note that we use COUNT then the specific item, since using COUNT(*) would retunr the number of rows, which may include duplicates.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(p.ProductID) BikeModels, AVG(p.ListPrice) AveragePrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c
ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID
WHERE c.Name LIKE '%Bikes';
```
