## Introduction to Transact-SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language was first developed in the 1970s by IBM as a way of interacting with databases. Other vendors have specfic versions of SQL for instance Oracle is PL/SQL, Microsoft's implentation is TSQL or Transact SQL.  Both SQL Server (on prem) and Azure SQL Databases (cloud) use the same query language, however Azure is a subset of full TSQL since it some commands relate to local files and data functions within .NET that relate only to SQL Server.  However, as new features are added to Azure, some new commands are being added to Azure. 

SQL is a declarative language - you express what it is that you want, the results - rather than specifying the steps taken to acheive that - it is not prodecural like other programming languages, it is set theory based.  It is possible to write proceedural elements or steps within TSQL, however if this is ocurring a lot, it is perhaps better done in another language, which may also perform or run better.  

In databases, we typically talk about entities - one type of thing - which is contained in each table.  
* Entities are represented as relations (tables) 
* And entity attributes as domains (columns)

Most relationships are normalized, with relationships between primary and foreign keys.  This helps to reduce duplication, however there are instances where de-normalised data is desired.  

Schemas are namespaces for database objects - is shows a logical layout for all or part of a relational database, _"As part of a data dictionary, a database schema indicates how the entities that make up the database relate to one another, including tables, views, stored procedures, and more."_(see [Lucid Chart on Database Schemas](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/database-diagram/database-schema)).  The process of creating a database schema is called data modelling.  

When referring to objects in a database, we could use a fully qualified name, such as:

* [server_name.][database_name.][schema_name.]object_name

This is only really relevant for SQL Server, since Azure will only work with one database at a time.  Most of the time we typically just use

* schema_name.object_name

The schema name somwtimes be discarded, but it is considered best practice to include this, since there is sometimes some ambiguity about tables e.g. if we have two tables - Product.Order and Customer.Order  - which order table is being referred to, that in the customer or product schema?

SQL has a number of SQL Statement Types:

* DML or Data Manipulation Language - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
* DDL or Data Definition Language - CREATE, ALTER, DROP
* DCL or Data Control Language - GRANT, REVOKE, DENY

The course focuses on DML which is typically for working with data.  

**SELECT** statement has a number of possible sub-components:

* FROM [table]
* WHERE [condition for filtering rows]
* GROUP BY [arranges rows by groups]
* HAVING [condition for filtering groups]
* ORDER BY [sorts the output]

Whilst a SQL statement can look like English, it doesn't neccessarily run from top to bottom in terms of the sequence of elements that are run in a query.  For instance, the FROM is the first thing that will be run, then the WHERE filter will be run, then we GROUP BY, then  SELECT the columns we are interested in and finally ORDER the results.  This can be important when running some queries, which will be explored later in the course.  When we run a query, it is not an actual table in a database that is return but a set of rows or record set or subset.

### Data Types

There are a number of different data types in T-SQL as shown below, which are grouped in to a number of different types.  

```{r Data Types, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Transact-SQL Data Types'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TSQL/TSQLDataTypes.png")
```

This is more relevant when designing a database, however it is useful to know when querying what data type you have in a broad sense - numeric, data, string and so on - as the types will determine what type of combinations can be combined together in expressions  e.g. you can concatenate strings or add numbers together, but you can't concatenate a string and a number together. 

Sometimes it is neccessary to convert data from one type to another, there are two ways this could happen

* Implicit conversion - compatible data types are automatically converted 
* Explicit conversion - requires an explicit function e.g. CAST / TRY_CAST, STR, PARSE ? TRY_PARSE, CONVERT / TRY_CONVERT

The TRY options will attempt a conversion and if it does not work, a NULL will be returned rather than an error in the non-TRY version.   

### Working with NULLs

There are recognised standards for treating NULL values - ANSI - which says that anythign involving a NULL should return a NULL.  There are functions that help us handle NULL values:

* ISNULL(column/variable, value) - Returns _value_ (which you can specify) if the column or variable is NULL
* NULLIF(column/variable, value) - Returns NULL if the column or variable is a value - we are almost recoding a non-null to a null
* COALESCE (column/variable1, column/variable2, ...) - Returns the value of the first non-NULL column or variable in the list - for instance if contact details, someone might not have an email, so we might want a telephone number, if they don't have that, return an address etc

NULL is used to indicate an unknown or missing value. NULL is **not** equivalent to zero or an empty string.

ISNULL can be used like an IF function in excel, for instance:

> SELECT name, ISNULL(TRY_CAST(size AS Integer), 0) AS NumericSize  
  FROM SalesLT.Product;

In this instance, if there is a value that will be returned, if not, the NULL value will be returned as a 0.  

We can also use a CASE statement to return a value whilst integrating NULL in to our query, e.g.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT name,  
    CASE size  
      WHEN 'S' THEN 'SMALL'  
      WHEN 'M' THEN 'MEDIUM'  
      WHEN 'L' THEN 'LARGE'  
      WHEN 'XL' THEN 'EXTRA LARGE'  
      ELSE ISNULL(Size, 'N/A')  
    END AS PRODUCT  
  FROM SalesLT.Product; 
```

### Lab Exercises

AdventureWorks Cycles is a company that sells directly to retailers, who then sell products to consumers. Each retailer that is an AdventureWorks customer has provided a named contact for all communication from AdventureWorks.

The sales manager at AdventureWorks has asked you to generate some reports containing details of the company's customers to support a direct sales campaign. Let's start with some basic exploration.

First we display the sales person, the customer's title, surname and telephone number

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesPerson, Title + ' ' + LastName AS CustomerName, Phone
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

Next we cast the CustomerID column to a VARCHAR and concatenate with the CompanyName column

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) + ': ' + CompanyName AS CustomerCompany
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

The SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table contains records of sales orders. You have been asked to retrieve data for a report that shows:

The sales order number and revision number in the format <Order Number> (<Revision>) (e.g. SO71774 (2)).
The order date converted to ANSI standard format yyyy.mm.dd (e.g. 2015.01.31).

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesOrderNumber + ' (' + STR(RevisionNumber, 1) + ')' AS OrderRevision,
	   CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), OrderDate, 102) AS OrderDate
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;
```

Next we write a query that returns a list of customer names.  We use ISNULL to check for middle names and concatenate with FirstName and LastName.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + ISNULL(MiddleName + ' ', '') + LastName
AS CustomerName
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

Next, we will imagine that some data has been deleted - customer email addresses - then we try to find contact details in sequence.  

```{sql connection=con}
UPDATE SalesLT.Customer
SET EmailAddress = NULL
WHERE CustomerID % 7 = 1;
```

Next we write a query that returns a list of customer IDs in one column, and a second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if known, and otherwise the phone number.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT CustomerID, COALESCE(EmailAddress, Phone) AS PrimaryContact
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
```

You have been asked to create a query that returns a list of sales order IDs and order dates with a column named ShippingStatus that contains the text "Shipped" for orders with a known ship date, and "Awaiting Shipment" for orders with no ship date.

Again, we imagine that some data is missing by deleting some first.

```{sql connection=con}
UPDATE SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
SET ShipDate = NULL
WHERE SalesOrderID > 71899;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate,
  CASE
    WHEN ShipDate IS NULL THEN 'Awaiting Shipment'
    ELSE 'Shipped'
  END AS ShippingStatus
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;
```

## Querying Tables with SELECT

### Removing Duplicates

If we wanted to know what colours our products are, we would run something like the following.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Color
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Here each product has a row and corresponding colour.  However, if we just want colour, we are typically interested in removing duplicates to just show what colours we are actually producing.  This is achieve using the DISTINCT keyword

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT Color
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

These results are DISTINCT at the row level, so if we have two combinitions of columns - say size and colour - then it would be DISTINCT colour and size combinations that appear in the database.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT Color, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```

Here is just the size - here IS NULL will return a 'None' if the Size is missing (NA).

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT ISNULL(Size, 'None') AS Size
FROM SalesLT.Product;
```


### Sorting Results

ORDER By is how we sort the results.  Any aliased fields used in the SELECT element are visible by ORDER BY.  You can oder the results using columns that are not selected in the SELECT clause.  You can also ORDER BY multiple columns, either ascending or descending.

We can also just show the top 10 products, e.g. the top 10 most expensive.  This is done using the keywork TOP

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT TOP (10) ProductCategoryID AS Category, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY ListPrice DESC, Category;
```

We can also use TOP (N) Percent or TOP (N) WITH TIES.  If we say wanted the bottom 10 items - say those with the lowest price - there is no 'BOTTOM' Keyword, instead we would sort our data so that they are now in the the order we want - with those we are interested at the top - the use TOP again.  

### Paging through results

This is achieved through using the OFFSET-FETCH which is an extension of ORDER BY.  This might be useful if you have a set of web page results and you want to see certain ones.  

You first say how many rows you want to skip using e.g. OFFSET 10 ROWS, then use specify how many rows you are interested in retrieving from the database e.g. FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY.

### Filtering and Using Predicates

We can use the WHERE clause with a number of coniditions or predicates.  For instance = (equals) <> (not equals), IN, BETWEEN (is an inclusive statement e.g. BETWEEN 100 AND 200 includes 100 and 200), LIKE,  AND, OR and NOT.  IN can be more efficient in coding terms when testing multiple attributes, as you just say color IN (red, blue) rather than colour  = 'red' OR colour = 'blue'.  This becomes more useful when testing multiple conditions e.g. IN (red, blue) AND size = large - this would have more typing with explicit code for each combition.

Like mathematics, SQL works on PEMDAS sequencing - parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.  

Some examples.

First look for products that start with an FR:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'FR%';
```

Or we can look for products that end in a 58:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE '%58';
```

Or we can use underscores to specify a number of charecters e.g. one _ is one missing charecter.  A wildcard (%) would match any number of chars.  The figures in brackets then are like regex, so if we want a numeric value between 0 and 9 we use [0-9].  Equally we could use a similar query to find things like email addresses in a string, or email addresses that end in a .co.uk.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name, Color, Size, ProductNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-_[0-9][0-9]_-[0-9][0-9]';
```

We can use the BETWEEN clause on things like dates to select all products that were removed from sale in 2016:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name
FROM SalesLT.Product 
WHERE SellEndDate BETWEEN '2006/1/1' AND '2006/12/31';
```

Note that it is often useful to order results in the order you want, even if it currently appears it the correct order.  Sometimes these queries may change as data or the database does, so it is best to be explicit and use an ORDER BY.  

### Lab Exercises

You are being told that transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the top 10 percent from the Name column
SELECT TOP (10) Percent Name, Weight
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- order by the weight in descending order
ORDER BY Weight DESC;
```

Next, we want to ignore the first 10 records - to page through using offset

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
ORDER BY Weight DESC
-- offset 10 rows and get the next 100
OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS ONLY;
```

Next we create a query to find the names, colors, and sizes of the products with a product model ID of 1.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the Name, Color, and Size columns
SELECT Name, Color, Size
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- check ProductModelID is 1
WHERE ProductModelID = 1;
```

Now we would like more information on products of certain colors and sizes.  We retrieve the product number and name of the products that have a Color of 'Black', 'Red', or 'White' and a Size of 'S' or 'M'.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the ProductNumber and Name columns
SELECT ProductNumber, Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- check that Color is one of 'Black', 'Red' or 'White'
-- check that Size is one of 'S' or 'M'
WHERE Color IN ('Black', 'Red', 'White') AND Size IN ('S', 'M');
```

Next you have been asked to retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products that have a product number beginning with 'BK-'.

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the ProductNumber, Name, and ListPrice columns
SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- filter for product numbers beginning with BK- using LIKE
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-%';
```

Finally, the product manager is interested in a slight variation of the last request regarding product numbers with a particular prefix.

We are interested in products with product number beginning with 'BK-' followed by any character other than 'R', and ending with a '-' followed by any two numerals.  Not an R is [^R].

```{sql connection=con}
-- select the ProductNumber, Name, and ListPrice columns
SELECT ProductNumber, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
-- filter for ProductNumbers
WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-[^R]%-[0-9][0-9]';
```

## Querying Tables with Joins

We usually join tables based on primary key - foreign key relationships.  We don't run two queries then join, but match at the time of the query.  When we are talking about joins, we typically represent them as Venn diagrams.  

The convention (ANSI SQL-92) is to specify the JOIN operator in the FROM clause:

> SELECT ...
  FROM Table1 JOIN Table 2
  ON <on_predicate>;
  
There is an older standard (ANSI SQL-89) where the tables are joined using commas in the FROM clause and using a WHERE operator, but this can lead to accidental cartesian (aka cross) products.

### INNER Joins

INNER Joins are typically the most common join type.  It involves a join only where a match is found in both input tables.  You can add multiple joins after each other.

Some examples - first a basic inner join where the schema, table and column are explicitly stated. 

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SalesLT.Product.Name AS ProductName, SalesLT.ProductCategory.Name AS Category
FROM SalesLT.Product
INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory
ON SalesLT.Product.ProductCategoryID = SalesLT.ProductCategory.ProductCategoryID;
```

Next, we can do the same query but make this less cumbersome by using table aliases.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT p.Name AS ProductName, c.Name AS Category
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c
on p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID;
```

Next, we look at joining multiple tables, where we want the sales, including order level details, the products in the order and the product details.  If we don't specify the join type, the assumption is it is a INNER join, as shown below.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderNumber, p.Name As ProductName, od.OrderQty, od.UnitPrice, od.LineTotal
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
ORDER BY oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderID, od.SalesOrderDetailID;
```

It is possible to do joins based on more than one criteria, e.g. we could join based on the productID and where the ListPrice is less than the unitprice i.e. there has been a discount.

```{sql connection=con}
-- Multiple join predicates
SELECT oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderNumber, p.Name As ProductName, od.OrderQty, od.UnitPrice, od.LineTotal
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
JOIN SalesLT.Product AS p
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND od.UnitPrice < p.ListPrice --Note multiple predicates
ORDER BY oh.OrderDate, oh.SalesOrderID, od.SalesOrderDetailID; 
```

### OUTER Joins

In an outer join we return all the rows from one table, and any matching rows from the second table.  The records in the 'outer' table are preserved, typically we use language such as LEFT, RIGHT and FULL keywords.  We are pulling in records from that OUTER table.  FULL keeps records from both tables, but are typically not seen in practice.  OUTER is OPTIONAL e.g. LEFT JOIN is the same as LEFT OUTER JOIN.  

Now some examples.  First, we bring up a list of customers, with any matching sales records i.e. we have a list of customers who HAVE bought someting and those WHO HAVE NOT.  

```{sql connection=con}
--Get all customers, with sales orders for those who've bought anything
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
ORDER BY c.CustomerID;
```

Next we can look just for those customers who have not purchased anything using IS NULL.

```{sql connection=con}
--Return only customers who haven't purchased anything
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
WHERE oh.SalesOrderNumber IS NULL 
ORDER BY c.CustomerID;
```

Next we add records from multiple tables.  If we add tables on to the chain of tables, having first decleared a left or right join, you have to keep using LEFT joins.  You could use an INNER Join but you would loose some records e.g. if you used an INNER join on the second table below, you would loose those records (products) that had never been sold.  

Sometimes it is neccessary to go through one table to get to another e.g. to Products -> Orders requires going through order details first. Even if, we are not brining back any tables from the intermediary table.

```{sql connection=con}
--More than 2 tables
SELECT p.Name As ProductName, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
LEFT JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh --Additional tables added to the right must also use a left join
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
ORDER BY p.ProductID;
```

Next another example with multiple tables, but this time the order of the tables is different.  We SELECT from the product table, then we LEFT Join the Order details so we can identify products that have never sold, then we LEFT JOIN to the order header table so we can get the order number where we use a left outer join as we are left joining those records to our original table.  Then we INNER Join product category, because we are joining product category back to the first table - Products.  The final table joins back to our original table, before the outer joins.  So whether you need to use an OUTER or INNER join depends on where you wish to place the records based on the current list of tables, however you could reorder the tables to do it differently e.g. do the INNER JOIN first, then then LEFT JOINS.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT p.Name As ProductName, c.Name AS Category, oh.SalesOrderNumber
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
LEFT OUTER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON od.SalesOrderID = oh.SalesOrderID
INNER JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory AS c --Added to the left, so can use inner join
ON p.ProductCategoryID = c.ProductCategoryID
ORDER BY p.ProductID;
```
